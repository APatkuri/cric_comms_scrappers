The second session, not so good for the visitors as the Australians hit back with quick wickets. In the third one, Mohammad Rizwan scored briskly but given out controversially by the third umpire. Asad Shafiq then added useful 84 runs with the help of Yasir Shah before the Aussie seamers bundled the visitors for 240. It is time for Day 2 now. Will the Aussie be able to take a lead with a huge first inning total or will Pakistan be able to spring a surprise with their young and inexperienced pace attack? We will find that out soon. Welcome to our coverage for the same."

However, post the Lunch break, the pacers combined to pick quick wickets to push Pakistan on the back foot. From 75/0, Pakistan were reeling at 94/5. The late fight from Shafiq and Yasir kept the bowlers at bay for a while. Things changed as soon as Starc got the second new cherry in his hand. He along with Cummins combined together to close the Pakistani innings."

Mohammad Rizwan and Asad Shafiq then added 49 runs between them to provide some stability. However, a poor call from the third umpire saw Rizwan depart. Shafiq and then Yasir combined together to add 84 runs between them to take Pakistan's total over 200. In the process, Shafiq raked up his 24th Test half ton. But eventually the hosts' pacers had the last laugh as they finished off the things just at the close of the day."

Now, Naseem comes halfway down the track for the single but Shafiq sends him back. Luckily for the batsman, the fielder is not to the ball when he is halfway down the track. Gets back in time.

The umpire though is not interested as he turns down the appeal. Paine thinks and thinks and almost decides against the review. However, Smith from the slip cordon asks him to go for the review. With just 4 seconds left on the clock, he goes for the review. First, Hot Spot. Massive spot on the bat. Here comes the Ultra Edge, a faint tickle has been spotted and Afridi has to walk back for a first-ball duck. Starc on a hat-trick!"

A surprising, surprising call from the third umpire. Rizwan will feel hard done by here. Coming to the shot, it was a poor one though. A good length ball outside off, Rizwan pushes at the ball with hard hands but manages only a tickle behind. A straightforward chance for Paine behind the wickets. Now, here is the drama. The on-field umpire is not sure whether the bowler has overstepped, so he sends it upstairs. There are plenty of replays shown and in every one of them, it appears that when the foot lands, the heel is on the line. Nothing is behind. The third umpire, Michael Gough, feels that there is something though. And gives the benefit of doubt to the bowler! Strange, strange call. Normally, the benefit of doubt always goes to a batsman. Well, there is always a first time for things. The 49-run stand is broken and the attacking innings from Rizwan has been cut short."

Babar Azam came in and disappeared in no time, playing a reckless shot. Asad Shafiq and Mohammad Rizwan are amidst a 31-run stand and they would look to keep it going. The hosts, on the other hand, would look to close the innings quickly. Interesting session ahead. Join us for the final session to find out."

However, one thing the Aussies could have done better was bowling a little bit fuller. We may see their lengths change in the next session though. They will come out with the air of breaking this stand as quickly as possible and then look to make further inroads. Join us for what could be another intriguing session in a while."

When the Aussie side last wore the baggy green, they made sure that the Urn remained with them after their spirited performance in England. Steven Smith made his return to whites and how. The world no. 1 bowler Pat Cummins has been in terrific form. What does that mean? Well, Pakistan has not won a Test in the country since 1995 and the above sentence will tell you that if they are to win one, they will be up against the likes of Smith and Cummins who will lead the batting and bowling unit of the hosts. The visitors, as always have an exceptional pace attack with a certain 16-year-old Naseem Shah set to make his Test debut. Babar Azam is one of the top batters going around in the world right now and would want to prove that. He will hope for some assistance from others around him in order to tackle Tim Paine's bowlers. Will Pakistan be able to do so or will Australia continue to dominate them at home? We will soon find out. Toss and team updates in a while."

He  is unbeaten on 171 runs along with skipper Tim Paine. Marnus is looking strong out in the middle and has already gone past 150-run mark. After the wicket of Smith, he along with Wade added 110 runs with the former raking up a well made half ton before getting out to Haris Sohail. Now, with 2 days and a session left, what will the Aussies be thinking? Maybe a double ton for Labuschagne and then the declaration? Or will they bat little longer to bat Pakistan completely out of the game. Pakistani bowlers, well, they have been on the field for 146 overs and they would be hoping for the declaration to come as soon as possible. Interesting to see what tactics Australia come out to bat with in the final session. Be back for that post this mini-break."

It is his first tour to Australia and it does take time to get used to large grounds. Kamran Akmal would have been a helpful here as he would have shouted - 'Ghoomegi!'."

They have swelled their lead to 155 runs already and are still going strong. Courtesy a brilliant maiden Test ton from Marnus Labuschagne. Wade joined Marnus after the wicket of Smith and has added 37 runs quickly. As far as Pakistan bowling is concerned, they kept Warner silent in the first hour of the session. Naseem and Yasir were the two bowlers who got wickets this morning. Naseem looked threatening and removed Warner with a vicious bouncer. Smith showed us that he is a human too as he fell cheaply to Yasir Shah. Now, while Pakistan have managed to get a couple of wickets in the session, they will have to get a few more wickets as quickly as possible in the afternoon session. Will they be able to do so or will Labuschagne and Wade put on another big stand to keep the lead swelling further? Join us for the afternoon session to find out."

This is a fuller ball and outside off, Marnus looks to drive but gets a thick outside edge. As soon as Labuschagne sees the ball going through the slip cordon, he raises his bat and celebrates. After 4 half tons, he finally gets to the three figure mark in Test match cricket."

Rizwan there dives to his left and pouches it superbly. Naseem went past the outside edge twice in the over and he deserved this wicket. They check for the no ball but this is a legal delivery. No respite for Warner this time and he needs to continue his walk to the pavilion. Standing ovation as he walks off after a brilliant century."

While Burns missed out on a ton, David Warner completed one and remained unbeaten on 151 runs. He has Marnus Labuschagne for the company when he resumes his innings in a while. Pakistani bowlers looked haywire on the entire second day and will have to put a spirited performance to pull their side back in the game. To do so, they need to bundle the Aussies out as quickly as possible and keep the deficit to the minimum. Will they be able to do so or will the hosts' batters pile on their misery for the bowlers? We will have all the answers soon. Welcome to our coverage of Day 3."

Yasir went round the wicket for this ball and the change of angle worked for him there. The massive 222-run stand is broken."

Yasir Shah gets to the ball and fires the throw at the non-striker's end. He hits the stumps and the umpire refers it upstairs. Looks safe from one angle but mighty close from another one. Not out says the third umpire and Warner's march towards his century continues."

Well, no, not really. They are checking for the front foot no ball, so hang on. Naseem has overstepped and by a big margin. The 16-year-old looks dejected as he goes back to his bowling mark. His skipper Azhar Ali gives him pat on the back."

The Pakistani bowlers have not tested them much. While they hardly got any assistance from the surface, they were not consistent with their lines and lengths throughout. Warner has brought up his 31st half ton and looking solid out in the middle. He will look to convert this one into a massive one. Seems like a long and hard day for the Pakistani seamers and spinners. They need quick wickets to get back in the game. Will they be able to do so or the Australian openers will continue piling on the runs? Join for the afternoon session to find out."

On his maiden Test century at his home ground, Labuschagne says that it is very special to have everything pan out like that and is happy that he could contribute to the team's winning cause. On the nervous moments before his ton. Marnus admits that it was tough as he was keeping on thinking whether he will get there and believes he was lucky to get there. Adds that it was a big moment for him and his family. On his batting technique and mindset, Labuschagne says that playing in England has helped him and here, in Queensland as well, batting ain't easy, so that made him mentally tough. Is looking forward for the Day/Night Test in Adelaide."

On contributions other than Steven Smith, Tim is happy as the team does not want to rely on Smith pretty heavily. Stresses that on a very good wicket, 580 is exactly the score that was expected out of the batsmen. On Warner getting back to form, the skipper says that many left-handers struggle in England but they always believed that Warner will strike form in Australia. On the Warner-Burns partnership, Paine says that he is not sure, as he has not spent too much time with Burns in the dressing room but is happy that whatever it is that keeps the pair ticking, it is great. On Marnus Labuschagne, Paine says that he is a great bloke to have as a mate, always keeping the dressing room in high spirits. Is happy that Labuschagne has realized his true potential. On his bowlers, Paine says that they were good but given the high standards that they have raised for themselves, he would have expected them to clean up Pakistan a bit earlier. But adds that Australia are lucky to have such a pace attack."

Praises the debutant Naseem for having good temperament for a 16-year old, adjusting to the lengths and lines pretty quickly. On him being given just 4 overs on Saturday, Azhar says that Naseem is fit but the management does not want him to break down, hence they are managing him accordingly."

From there on, it was very difficult for them to come back and Warner-Burns' 222-run opening stand floored them. Yasir Shah was over the moon when he dismissed Steven Smith for the 7th time in Tests but they forgot that the Ashes had already prepared a substitute for Smudge - Marnus Labuschagne. The home lad played with total control and ensured that his side batted Pakistan out of the Test. Yasir Shah got 4 wickets but the bowling did not look threatening at all.

It is difficult to say who spent a longer time at the crease after getting out - Rizwan or Sohail yesterday. A short ball outside off, Rizwan leaps and plays the upper cut but he finds Nathan Lyon at deep backward point! Is the innings defeat still on? 35 more needed for Pakistan to avoid that.

The South African pouches it and then claims the catch, celebrating as well. Umpire Kettleborough checks with Illingworth about the carry and then sends it upstairs, with the soft signal as OUT.

He along with Yasir Shah has added 42 runs and would want the stand going as big as they can. Lyon managed the prized scalp of Azam in the session after the latter played a classy knock of 104. Now, how long these two batters can keep the association going? Will they be able to take the game into the fifth day? Join us for the final session of the day to find out."

The umpire raises his finger and Babar walks off. He shows his bat to the crowd as he gets a massive applause. Pakistan might still lose this by an innings but it has an excellent fight shown by Babar and Rizwan. The deficit is now 114."

Paine just thinks and thinks and then takes the review. Let us see what the replays show. Hot Spot first, nothing on it. Time for Snicko, no deflection there. Here comes the Ball Tracker. Just clipping the leg stump, so, umpire's call it will be. This can be termed a unlucky one for the bowling side or maybe not because had the umpire given Babar out, one would feel that the batter was unlucky there. Australia retain the review but fail to send Babar packing, for now."

Babar Azam is out in the middle. He looked solid during his 20-run unbeaten innings. He will be key for Pakistan if they are to push the game to Day 5 or rather in the second or third session of Day 4. Mitchell Starc bowled a few thunderbolts and got two wickets early in the innings. Cummins looked sharp along with Hazlewood. Will Australia need the spin of Lyon? What is on offer for us on Day 4? Will Babar Azam and co. be able to gut it out or will Starc and company bundle the visitors to seal the game? Stay with us to find out."

Both feel that yes, Starc bowled well but perhaps some balls before that played in Azhar's mind. So far, we have not seen the ball swing much and guess Ali felt the same. Hence, he was just trying to get across and tuck the ball to the leg side. Normally, when you do that, you get away with it to a left-armer from over the wicket. Because the balls tend to pitch outside the line. But Starc got the ball to come back in, which proved to be fatal for the Pakistan skipper. Crucially, the ball was pitched in line."

Maybe, he adds, play a few more games at number 5 or 6, get some experience, score runs and then earn that number 3 spot."

Azhar Ali does not look sure as he walks towards the non-striker. Seems like he will not review that one, but hello, with just two seconds left on the timer, he signals the 'T'. Let's see what the replays show. There is nothing on Snicko and Hot Spot. Ball Tracker shows that it is pitching in line and clipping the top of the middle stump. Pakistan retain the review but their skipper has to depart. Early strike for Australia, exactly what they would've wanted."
