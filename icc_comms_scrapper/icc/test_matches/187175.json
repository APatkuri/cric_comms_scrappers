They booed him when he arrived, they booed him when he got to 50 but on his century, all have stood up as one. No celebration from Smith though. Or shall we say, not much. Just a removal of the helmet and a swish of the bat through the air. Full and outside off, the former skipper leaned into the shot and got it past the tumbling Stuart Broad at short extra cover. Well played, sir."

The umpire thinks it is pad. Root and his teammates gather and mull over taking the review but decide against it. With 8 wickets down maybe they could have gone for it, as it is Smith. Correction. Good they did not go for it. Because, the replays roll in and show that the bat is inside the line of the ball and it has indeed hit the pad. Terrific decision by Aleem Dar here."

No review taken. Should have been. Hawk Eye shows it to be missing leg stump. What an over from Broad, especially the last 3 balls - W 0 W."

Woakes and co. go up in a confident appeal but the umpire is unmoved. Root though takes the referral. Ultra Edge rolls in and shows no spike, Hawk Eye follows and it shows all red. The crowd roars in joy and Wade's return to Test cricket is a short lived one. Australia in big trouble here. Half the side down with the score just over 100."

Khawaja, who was looking good in his short stay followed suit soon. But Head then joined Smith and the duo has done well to steady the ship, adding 48 runs and ensuring that the visitors do not lose any other wicket before the break. The hosts, have bowled well but this partnership has troubled them. Root had to use 5 bowlers in the first session. With Broad and Woakes amongst the wickets, it has been a battling session and just as expected been a brilliant battle between the bat and ball. Join us in a while for the second session of Day 1."

He comes half-forward and there is a noise as the ball goes past the bat. Bairstow sort of half-appeals but there is nothing from the umpire. Woakes is not sure, perhaps thinking that the bat hit the pad. The slip cordon is sure and Root takes the review. Ultra Edge shows a spike when the ball goes past the bat and umpire Wilson has to overturn his decision. Australia into their soft, softer, softest underbelly of a middle order."

Joe Root and his troops will look to regain the urn and make 2019 the greatest year in England's sporting history. Australia, on the other hand, do not have a fond memory at Edgbaston and it was at this very venue that this very opponent knocked them out of the World Cup. James Pattinson is all set to return in the baggy green. If the hosts are looking to regain the urn then the visitors are looking to retain the urn. Who will win the battle of Birmingham?

For that though, they would need all their batters to do their part. England on the other hand, are probably a bowler short, they though have a 90-run cushion. Their first aim will be to get a few wickets before Australia cross 90 and then never let the pressure release. Seeing how Lyon bowled, a lot will be expected of Moeen Ali. The last session is a very important one and it could probably decide which way this game turns. Do join us in a while for it."

Cummins was not brilliant throughout but did get into his own as the game progressed. Lyon also finished with a three-fer, he too was very good. Siddle also had a good time with the ball, he kept it tight and also took two. The scoreboard does show England scored close to 400 but overall it was a good bowling performance by Australia."

Don't know what Moeen was thinking when he decided to leave the ball. Probably the first ball Lyon bowled to Root, yesterday, was in his mind. He might have felt this would also turn a long way but it does not. Now though he will be reminded of this wicket by everyone. End of a brilliant over from Lyon! Two wickets in it and Australia are now into the fast bowlers."

Burns walks off to a huge standing ovation, he shows his bat to the crowd to soak in all the applause. But hold on a minute, the umpires check for the no ball and.... Lyon is just in by a whisker.

The ball is too close to play that shot. The outside edge is taken and Paine does not make a mistake behind. Half the side back in the hut for England and they are still two runs away from Australia's score."

He is on 125 and whether he finally gets to that daddy hundred or not which Graham Gooch so often wants the English batsmen to get, is a thing worth seeing.

Cummins gets his first and he is ecstatic. This is around middle and it straightens. Buttler looks to work it with the angle but the movement off the pitch does him in. It takes the leading edge and goes low to third slip. Bancroft there takes an excellent low catch diving to his right. Australia crawling their way back after the ball was changed. They hardly got any movement before and now due to the movement, they have two. England still 90 away."

He kept taking the ball away in his last over. This time, he gets the ball to come back in. It starts from outside off, the length too is fuller. Denly looks to drive but misses as he plays outside the line. The ball hits the back pad. An appeal follows and the umpire raises the finger. Denly does have a chat with his partner but does not review. Rightly so as Hawk Eye shows three reds. A budding stand comes to an end. England are 95 away from Australia's first innings score. Another wicket quickly and Australia will be right back into the contest."

Roy is drawn into the stroke. He tries to drop his hands at the end but the ball kisses the outside edge and goes low to Smith at second slip. He takes a good catch. James is pumped up and Australia get rid of the dangerous Roy early. England trail by 262."

When the visitors were crumbling at 122/8, it looked like there is plenty on the pitch for the seamers. But then, looking at the way Siddle and Lyon played, it gives plenty of confidence to the hosts' batsmen. What exactly is there in the pitch then? Actually, not much. It was swing which got the better of OZ and they would need exactly that to stop England. Overcast conditions did not help them either. Conditions today are bright and sunny, so that could mean extra work for the Aussie bowlers."

First, it was Broad, who ran through the fragile Aussie batting line-up, to finish with a 5-for and get into the list of bowlers with 100 Ashes wickets. Then, there was Woakes, who just strut his stuff with the Dukes ball. But the man who was missed the most. His 4 overs were the only output for England and his absence, can be argued, allowed the Aussies to recover."

On a day when nothing much seemed to go right for Australia, this man stuck his guts out like wet sand sticks onto dry paper, making the Barmy Army eat humble pie. A day which saw the Aussies tottering at 122/8, ended with OZ finishing with 284. Of which, the former skipper scored JUST 144. Yes, just. What a way to begin the opening day of the 2019 Ashes.

This wicket will inject a lot of positivity into them. Woakes bowls this fuller and outside off, it swings away further. Smith goes after it but due to the movement, the ball goes off the outside edge and Bairstow takes it with a dive to his right. Maybe a lapse in concentration for Smith as he was generally leaving such deliveries. Nevertheless, end of a magical innings by Smith. He walks off to a standing ovation and he deserves every bit of it. It is because of him, Australia are in the position they are. For England though, is this the opening they needed? It has to be if they are to actually get back into the game."

Actually replays show, had Joe Root been behind the stumps, collected the ball and whipped the bails off, Smith would have still been short. Root though would have felt it was an easy double and hence, he was standing in front of the stumps and in the end, he failed to collect the throw. Another opportunity goes abegging.

What a comeback from him! Absolutely brilliant. This would be a big, big moment and an emotional one too for him. The English fans are heard booing him as he takes his helmet off and celebrates but he won't care and instead enjoy the moment. He gets to his ton in style. Broad bowls it full and around off, Smith creams it between two short cover fielders and past normal covers for a boundary. He needs no reminding though that his job is still not done. It is his 25th Test ton."

They added a massive 130-run stand and took Australia's lead past the 100-run mark. Head got to his fifty and was looking set for a big score but Stokes got him slashing to a ball outside off which saw his downfall. Wade however, has come out with positive intent and the two are amidst a 26-run stand. Australia will know, one good partnership and they will probably bat England out of the game. Smith though holds the key, he is on 98 and the visitors would hope the rest bat around him."

A wicket against the run of play but England will take it with both hands. Their Test vice-captain has given his side the much-needed breakthrough. Stokes steams in and bowls a good length delivery outside off, Head goes for the cut. Stokes however, had rolled his fingers on the delivery and hence the ball arrives slower than what Travis anticipated and also it bounces a little more. It takes the outside edge and goes towards the keeper. Bairstow dives in front and takes a very good low catch. Crucial wicket this as the duo of Smith and Head was taking the game away from the hosts. The umpires also check for the no ball but that too is fine. The 130-run stand is broken. Australia lead by 115 runs. England will now hope this opens the floodgates."

The pendulum in this match is right in the balance as we begin another exciting day of Test cricket. The opening hour will be very crucial for both sides as a couple of wickets will see the balance of power shift to the hosts but if the overnight pair see out this phase then one will have to put Australia on top as there is turn and bounce on offer for the spinners. Historically, Day 4 has been a very crucial day at Edgbaston and that won't change in this game as this back and forth game might just put someone in the driver's seat today. So on this action packed Sunday we welcome you to the coverage of the penultimate day of the first Ashes Test."

Broad after conceding two boundaries in the over bowls an absolute jaffa! Back of a length ball around off. It is a line which questions the batsman. Warner is in double mind to play or leave that. He initially looks to play but then decides to leave. He is late in his decision as when he looks to leave the ball kisses his outside edge and goes to the right of the keeper. Bairstow takes the catch and goes up in celebration. The umpire though is unmoved and Root takes the review. Replays roll in and it shows there is a good amount of edge on it. The English crowd are up in joy. Warner walks back disappointed. Early setback for Australia. Usman Khawaja replaces him out in the middle."

However, three wickets even before the deficit was wiped off, surely made England favorites. Yet again though Steve Smith and another comeback man, Matthew Wade, batted England out of the game with tons. Australia managed to score 487, giving England a target of 398 which was impossible to chase on the last day but a draw was on the cards."

They wanted wickets in the first session and they have got 4 of them. It all hinged on how would Nathan Lyon do on this turning wicket and he has done remarkably. The GOAT has picked three wickets, including the big wicket of English skipper, Joe Root. Denly and Roy were his other victims. Lyon has been well supported by the trio of fast bowlers. In a pitch where there has been nothing for the seamers, Cummins, Siddle and Pattinson have bowled with determination and aggression not allowing England to get any easy runs. Cummins was the other one to get into the wickets column."

It takes the inside edge of the bat and goes straight to short leg. Bancroft there does really well and takes a very good sharp catch.

Denly looks to work it on the leg side but the ball hits the inside edge then the pad and lobs to Bancroft at short leg. Australia are celebrating and the umpire gives it out for caught. Denly walks upto his partner and reviews at the very end. Replays roll in and Ultra Edge shows a spike. Denly has to take the long walk back. Australia 7 wickets away now."

The wicket yesterday was on the slower side but being the 5th day, there might just be more wear and tear and more assistance to the bowlers. It is not going to be easy for the home side. The first session, actually, the first hour is the important one. If England play that out without much damage, they would back themselves to save this game. An exciting day of cricket waits ahead.
