The conditions on day one demanded a lot of application which the Australian batsmen, barring Warner and Labuschagne, failed to show. But the English have the problems of their own where their skipper has failed to inspire and the rest of the team has been found wanting for runs."

They are well behind the 8-ball and unless they restrict England under 225, they might well be looking at this as a 2-match series with all square.

It always looked plumb to the naked eye and with covered eyes taking technology's aid, it ain't looking any less plumb. A full toss, in line of the stumps, Labuschagne looked to work it to the leg side but was beaten by the late dip. He got hit on the pads and Stokes started to celebrate before appealing. Umpire Wilson took his time but then raised his finger. Labuschagne immediately took the review and so surprising it was that even Jonny Bairstow asked him, 'Mate, did you hit it?' Don't know what Labuschagne replied but when the Ultra Edge was queried at the time the ball passed the bat, there was no spike. After that, it became pretty clear what Ball Tracker was going to show. Three reds. Labuschagne shakes his head as he walks off but he has to go. End of a terrific innings."

There is a noise as the ball goes past and umpire Joel Wilson raises his finger. Cummins immediately reviews and now, here comes the joke. There are two noises heard - one before the ball even comes near the bat and the second, after the ball passes the bat. Ultra Edge is called for and it shows two spikes - one before the ball is a centimetre away from the bat and the one after the ball passes the willow! That is good enough for the third umpire who supports his mate downstairs. Cummins is surprised but has to walk back."

The West Indian backs that statement with good evidence. He compares the delivery point of Archer at Lord's with Headingley. Jofra's head was going ahead of the popping crease at the time of delivery at Lord's but here, it's staying behind. That's the sign which has prompted Holding to comment so. Earlier, Ian Bishop has also expressed his concern over preserving Jofra Archer and managing his workload. When you are young, you don't realize but others around who are experienced must be using this raw talent with a bit of smartness."

Jofra lands this on a length outside off and then gets it to come back in with the angle. Pattinson looks like he has covered the line but while getting his bat down it hits his pad. That might be a signal that the willow came down a bit late. The ball takes the outside edge, on the higher part of the bat and goes straight to Joe Root at first slip who takes the catch near his chest."

Joe Root decides to review the decision and the Hawk Eye returns three reds. The brief resistance is over and Australia are in a serious danger of getting bundled out under 200.

Australia are placed in a tight situation and need yet another partnership to revive their innings. So far, Paine has done a good job along with Labuschagne and the aim of this pair will be to see off the day's play without any more casualty. Another hour left. Let's see how it goes."

Very. Stance, stroke-making, footwork, running, you name it. And who dismisses both? One man - Jofra Archer. Mode of dismissal, both identical. Both jaffas. The Harris one had some extra bounce. This one did not have that much bounce but plenty of movement. On a length outside off, Warner stays back to defend. The ball comes in with the angle but then straightens a touch, to square the opener up. Takes the outside edge and Jonny Bairstow does the rest. No century for Warner again. He looked in the mood tonight. But England are up and running. Is a collapse around the corner now? They check for the overstepping but the West Indian is fine."

It's an outswinger which has troubled Warner quite often in this innings. Broad has planted his delivery in the off stump channel and Warner is forced to play the line. But the ball changes its direction just a shade to beat his bat. There is some sound though, the English players are jumping up and down in an appeal and then the next frame shows Broad pumping his fists in celebration. The finger has gone up.

A length ball around off, angling away, Warner pushes at it early and hence fails to control his shot. It flies and evades the leaping backward point fielder for a boundary. Fine knock so far but he cannot afford to relax under these demanding conditions. Go on, get a big hundred and silence everyone with your bat."

The fielder there attacks the ball, takes aim and has a shy at the non-striker's end but misses. Instead, it has hit the bat of Warner and then the ball speeds past the mid on fielder for a boundary.

Root and his team though, have not gone far inside. There is no dugout in Tests but if ever there was one, there is this area just beyond the boundary, into the shelters and the English are standing over there.

It kisses the outside half of his bat and flies to the left of Jonny Bairstow. The Yorkshire lad makes no mistake as he snaps it safely. Not a happy Ashes debut for Marcus."

Smudge returning to bat even after that killer blow surprised many, everyone applauded his lion-hearted effort and it was so resounding that those few who booed failed to hear their own voices. Take two, Marnus Labuchangne got the chance to become the first concussion substitute and believe me, he didn't disappoint the great batsman he was replacing.

Their batsmen lacked the required application and we witnessed some questionable shot selection as well. Just four wickets left in the kitty and their deficit is 125 runs.

He grabbed four catches in the slip cordon and bounced back with a bang after a disappointing show at Lord's. He just needs another two to snatch that joint-record from Steven Smith and Vic Richardson for most catches by an Australian fielder in a Test innings. In fact, five catches are the most taken by a fielder from any team. So a world record is waiting for David after the break."

Sorry Stokes, it's a new day, new Test, new conditions and definitely new situation. Disappointing. Pattinson has managed to tempt the batsman with a fuller length ball way wide outside off. It should have been easily left alone but Stokes thinks about chasing it. He does so, throws his bat at it and gets a fat outside edge to the slip cordon. It reaches Warner at an awkward height at first slip but the Bull is ready to grab everything coming his way after a poor catching show at Lord's. The crowd here in Headingley is stunned. Only the Aussies are celebrating. England staring down the barrel big time."

First they got shot out for a minuscule total and then through some sloppy fielding allowed the Australian innings to prosper. There was an injury concern in the English camp during the closing hour of the day's play when Jofra Archer pulled up his side strain and the hosts will be hoping that he's fit to bowl today. Another 4 wickets left to take and they can still bounce back if they manage to pick them early in the morning session and then bat sensibly. The moving day is about to move, sit back and enjoy our coverage."

The slip cordon though, is busy looking at gully, where Joe Denly is coming running in to take the catch. Root is even more confident now and puts his entire strength in the appeal. Paine has a look at his partner, has a long discussion and then takes it upstairs. A bemused Root asks Paine why is he reviewing. Paine says he hit it. Then Root smiles and says that you are out caught! Shake of the head from the Aussie skipper. The third umpire is told by umpire Wilson that it is an LBW review. Dear me. Big inside edge, lobbing to gully. Umpire Wilson missed the nick. How on earth did Paine miss it? Waste of a review. Australia lose two quickly, bang bang. Effectively 276/6."

English bowlers look tired as they have spray all over the place after Tea. An interesting passage of play coming up. Will Australia get bowled out? Lets wait and watch."

Delivers a pinpoint yorker with good pace, right in the line of the stumps, Head brings his bat down to dig it out but it takes the inside edge and rattles the stumps. Looking at the replays, had his bat not come down in time, it would have missed the off stick. Bad luck in a way for the batter. The 45-run stand is broken and England would like to make use of this opening. The lead is 209 at the moment."

The English players appeal thinking it's pad first but the umpire stays put. Root asks his teammates regarding the usage of the DRS but he's not getting any convincing answer. The time lapses. The replays are shown after that. It confirms that the ball struck Marnus first on the pads but the impact is an issue. Later on, it shows the ball to be hitting the off stump. Interesting. It looked like spinning away but the ball just skidded through the line on the Ball Tracker. Hmm..."

The first was a walkover, the second was nerve-wracking and what about the third? Lost for words. Let us not test the vocabulary of anyone. Let us all take a break and then come back refreshed for the next episode of probably the greatest Test rivalry of all time. The 4th match will be played at Old Trafford, Manchester, on Wednesday, September 4, 2019 at 11 am local (1000 GMT). The points table as of now, stand with Sri Lanka leading with 60 points, followed by Australia (32) and then England (32). But these will change after the Test matches going on in Sri Lanka and West Indies. You can follow those as well, if you are not drained out and have any energy left. We take your leave and earn a nice break. ADIOS! TAKE CARE!"

Because Stokes was out in the next over, LBW, but was not given by umpire Joel Wilson and Australia did not have any review left! Before that ball, Stokes miscued a six over long off, almost ran out Jack Leach but Lyon fumbled. Well, PRESSURE! It gets to everyone, doesn't matter how experienced you are!"

The appeal goes up and so has the finger of umpire Gaffaney. Stuart thinks he has got some bat onto it and refers it upstairs. Ultra Edge picks no wood and the Ball Tracker confirms that it's hitting the stumps. 5 for 48 since Lunch and the end seems nigh for England."

Third flight, self-control, defend. Fourth flight, boom, self-destruct. Full and around off, plenty of loop. Archer gets down to mow again but this time, it takes the top edge. Travis Head gets across to his right at deep mid-wicket while Pat Cummins gets across to his left at long leg. Head takes the catch, but then tracks back. So he throws the ball in the air, then comes out and re-takes it, almost colliding with Cummins. Australia celebrate and Archer walks. But the umpires want to confirm and they do so. Replays show that the 25-run stand is broken. 73 more needed to win."

Hazlewood just puts a length delivery in the channel outside off, Woakes thinks that it's a scoring opportunity and goes for a booming drive. But he fails to keep it down and Wade makes no mistake in catching that. 98 more left to score, 3 wickets remaining."

The Aussies know that they have their man and start to celebrate. The onfield umpire takes it upstairs and the replays confirm that Buttler is miles away from the crease. Also, Lyon broke the stumps with his hands after the bails came off. All fair and Australia get the sixth wicket."

Lyon lets out an off spinner, it's full and around off, Root advances down the track and tries to heave it across the line. But it spins back in to take the inside edge, brushes his pads and lobs over Paine. Not sure when Warner saw that coming. But whenever he got the sight of it, he made sure to catch it with a full length dive to his left from first slip. Absolute ripper. Body blow to England. The Aussies are roaring."

Joe Root has struck form at the best possible time and his century partnership with Joe Denly has made sure that Australia don't run away with the Ashes. Having said that, it's a new day which will bring new challenges and with another 203 runs to get, this game is wide open. Needless to say, the morning session will give us a hint of which way this clash will be heading. 8 overs to go for the second new ball and that may have a big say on the outcome. We are not far away from the start, stay tuned."

But when the ball is doing nothing, it is the discipline and the patience of the bowlers which get tested. Australia had plenty. Cummins, Hazlewood and Pattinson kept clocking in high speeds and bowled tirelessly, beating the inside and outside edges, but without luck. Then, came the massive strangulation - 9-3-7-1 between Josh Hazlewood and Nathan Lyon which eventually got rid of Joe Denly. It would have been easy for a bowling unit to get frustrated and leak runs. But on a good pitch with not much swing around, Australia only gave away runs at just over 2 an over, a testimony to their discipline. That has ensured that in spite of the century stand, England have not run away with the game. Yet."

The ball brushes them and then ricochets off his helmet to Paine. The Aussie skipper grabs the simplest of catches and they all go up in a big appeal. The finger goes up and Denly looks down. He knows what has happened there. Root checks on him to know whether he wants to take the DRS but Denly declines the offer. Wicket number 3 goes down and England need another 218 runs from here to win."

They will have to stay patient and focus on execution. Good part is that they are not leaking runs and keep England under check in that part. 21 more overs to go before Stumps. Can they pick a wicket or two?"

They played on and on, tiring the Aussie bowlers and eventually succeeded in forcing Paine to bring on Marnus Labuschagne, the fifth bowler, which means, the fast bowlers were getting tired.

Something even the King Of Spin used to do in his hay days. Anyone remembers how he got out Marlon Samuels and Herschelle Gibbs in the 2000s? Predicted and then got them out in the same fashion. Genius. Legend."

Ball Tracker confirms. Going over the stumps. Denly has one thing in his favour for getting hit, if someone blames his technique. We have not seen too many balls misbehave, so indifferent bounce is slowly creeping into the equation now."

He says that Denly's first reaction to a short ball is to close his eyes. So might as well get that square leg to the slip cordon and plug the gap. Michael Holding joins in, says that Paine is almost challenging Denly to buy a lottery ticket of getting the ball through that slip cordon. But there is this gap between the second slip and gully, which, according to these experts, should be plugged. And rightly so."

From England's point of view, they will be planning to take it session by session. In total, 8 sessions are left and the remaining 348 runs can be chased down. But if you include the challenge of this pitch and the ordinary form of the England batting department, it becomes really challenging. Can the hosts step up with the bat and keep their Ashes hopes alive? Do join us in a short while for the post Lunch session."
