Good length ball pitching outside off, Santner leaves it assuming it to swing away but the ball comes in with the angle and hits him flush on the front pad. Sri Lankan players put in a huge appeal and the umpire raises his finger. Santner has a word with his partner, Southee and him opt against the review. Good decision as replays later on show that it would have been umpire's call as the ball was clipping the stumps enough to stay with the on-field call."

It would be unfair on the Lankans to expect Akila to pick up all the 10 wickets while Rosco alone cannot be scoring runs for the Kiwis. If the Lankans can restrict the Black Caps under 250, they are very well within a shout. On the flip side, if the Kiwis cross 250 and get to 275 and above, boy, they can make the ball talk on this pitch as well. Join us back at 3 pm local (0930 GMT)."

Join us after a while for the final session of the day."

He misreads the spin and it cuts the bat and body on its way to the keeper. Watling takes the bails off as Lahiru is too far in front."

Tim Southee and William Somerville stuck in with the bat and Trent Boult played a handy cameo as well. Sri Lanka were completely off colour and lacked the intent with the ball."

The Sri Lankan players put in a loud appeal and the umpire raises his finger. Ajaz takes the review with a glimmer of hope that something goes in his favour. Replay rolls in and shows that Dhananjaya de Silva's front foot was just, just around the crease. The line belongs to the umpire and the T.V umpire is happy with his front foot's landing. He then moves onto the Ball Tracker and it shows three reds. That will be the last action before Lunch. SRI LANKA NEED 268 TO WIN!"

Lahiru bowls it short on middle and off, Boult hangs back and plays the upper cut. He connects well but he cannot get it wide enough of third man. Dhananjaya de Silva there runs to his right and takes a simple catch. The 36-run stand has been broken. Sri Lanka will be happy to see his back as he was creating a lot of nuisance out in the middle for them. Lead is 242!"

Dimuth might have missed a trick here not getting Kumara earlier on but as the saying goes - Better late than never! End of a brilliant knock from BJ. He has played a critical role with the lower order batsmen and his efforts have taken his side to the lead of 206. End of the 46-run stand but a knock to remember from Watling, deserved a hundred but will have to be satisfied now with 77."

In spite of Sri Lanka dominating the majority of Day 3, New Zealand somehow fought back through BJ Watling's unbeaten knock and his crucial partnerships to gain the upper hand. The lead is currently 23 runs short of the 200-run mark and believe me, on this surface, it's going to be really tough to chase. As and when the weather permits, the first target of the home team will be to bundle out New Zealand as soon as possible and on the contrary, the Kiwis would love to swell their lead more. Exciting day ahead if the rain gods show some mercy."

Sri Lanka on the other hand, need to get the last three wickets quickly as the lead the Kiwis have now, is already going to be a tricky total to chase. Also, if Sri Lanka chase the target given to them, it is going to be the highest chase on this ground. They will have to bat really well to do so but for now, the remaining three wickets is their issue. Day 4 will probably give us a very nice idea to which way this game is going. Do join us at 0945 local (0415 GMT). Till then, take care and goodbye!"

Seeing that, Southee comes down the track. He though is beaten by the dip and the turn away as he looks to drive. The keeper collects and whips the bails off.

Southee looks to cut but the ball is too close to play that shot. It goes off the outside edge to the right of Dickwella. He is wrong footed but still manages to get a dive in. The ball hits the right outstretched glove but does not stick in. Deflects onto the body of Mathews who dives to his left and goes down to fine leg for one. A tough chance but had Dickwella not moved to his left, it would have been taken. They needed to break this stand. This could prove costly."

Apart from a 56-run stand between Latham and Nicholls, nothing else has been substantial from the visitors. With BJ Watling, the only recognized batsman out in the middle will hold the key. Sri Lanka will look to restrict them under 150 and New Zealand, on the other hand, will be looking to get closer to 200. What will happen? Join us in a while for the final session of Day 3."

It is a short ball, a nothing ball down the leg side from Embuldeniya which comes slow off the surface. Santner wanted to play the pull shot but is early into it as it sticks in the surface. A top edge is induced and it goes towards the deep mid-wicket fielder. Lakmal runs forward and across and takes a simple catch. Another batter walks back after getting off to a start. Another budding stand comes to an end. Santner walks back disappointed, all the other players follow him as it is TEA ON DAY 3!"

Dhananjaya was unlucky on that occassion but Kusal Mendis has not made the same error. De Silva bowls this slower through the air on off, it grips away off the surface. Nicholls looks to defend but the ball takes the outside edge and it goes to the left of first slip. Mendis there shows good reflexes and takes a sharp catch. Big wicket in the context of the game for Sri Lanka as Nicholls was looking very good out in the middle. Once again the Kiwis have their backs to the wall in this game. A well-deserved wicket for Dhananjaya de Silva."

Williamson was getting bogged down and he looks to break free here. He steps down the track to this flighted delivery on middle. He does not get to the pitch of the ball but still goes ahead with the shot. He only manages to hit it high in the air behind mid on. Perera runs back, he does not seem very comfortable under it but still manages to take it behind him. The Lankans are ecstatic and Williamson walks back disappointed. Back-to-back failures for him. You do not see that often. Sri Lanka right on top here."

He reaches there by dancing down the track and heaving a full ball with the spin. Lovely connection and it's a boundary at mid-wicket. Dimuth raises his bat in celebration. Wonderful knock so far and he would love to be there till the end."

Thirimanne sees the line and length closely and finds it good enough to opt for the sweep shot. He goes down on one knee to execute it but the ball straightens after landing, beats his bat and pings him on the pads. The appeal for an lbw follows but the umpire remains unmoved. Kane Williamson goes for the DRS and to his delight everything is fine in the replays. No bat involved, pitching in line, impact in line and it's hitting the leg pole. End of a fine knock by Lahiru, a career saving one? That only time will tell."

Don't be mistaken, New Zealand are still in this. If they can find a way to break this stand then they certainly would fancy themselves as they have runs on the board and there is some spin and drift on offer. Not going to be easy for a new batsman."

Dimuth Karunaratne not only took care of his innings but also supported Lahiru Thirimanne, who was a bit fidgety at the start. New Zealand bowled decently but weren't too penetrative. Their spinners tried hard but are not getting too much support from the surface. There is turn on offer but it's on the slower side and that has allowed the batsmen time to play. Also, the lines from the Kiwi spinners have been a little too straight. Another 192 runs left to win this Test match and the hosts will be feeling a lot better about themselves. We have 30 overs to go in the day. How will the last session pan out?  Do join us in a short while to find out."
