James Anderson was good as well but got just a wicket on his 150th Test. All in all the visitors will be happy with their performance."

He pokes at it away from his body and ends up nicking behind. Buttler catches it and celebrates. The umpire raises his finger but Philander goes for the review. Probably because it is there at his disposal. Don't think it is going to save him though. Here comes the replay. The front foot is okay. There seem to be a deflection as the ball passes the bat and the Ultra Edge clearly detects it. The decision stays OUT and that is the end of the innings for South Africa. 284/10 IT IS."

After their dismissal, Philander made sure they added further important runs. Broad struck on the last ball of the day to remove Rabada and finish the day on a high. Now, on Day 2, England would want to get rid of the last man as early as possible while the hosts would look to score a few quick runs to take their total around 300. Let's see what is on the cards.

Broad who has been struggling fought well to get 3 wickets and ended the day on a positive note. Jofra Archer struggled too but will be happy to get into the wickets column.

Hamza looked good for his 39 but could not convert his start. Faf too failed to make the most of the start he got. Rassie van der Dussen failed to make a mark on his debut. Quinton de Kock though walked out with intent and started counter-attacking as England were getting on top.  He put up a vital 87-run partnership with debutant Dwaine Pretorius. The latter fell against the run of play but Quinton continued his good work. He put up a gritty 47-run stand with Philander but he fell 5 short of a very well-deserved ton. Keshav Maharaj and Rabada ate away a few balls but both of them departed before stumps but ensured that the hosts walk out to bat at least for a ball on Day 2."

The ball takes the outside edge and goes low to Ben Stokes who pouches it inches above the turf. Maharaj is not sure if that carried to Stokes and he stands waiting. The umpire refers it upstairs with the soft signal being out. First the front foot is getting checked, it is fine. Now, did that carry? Yes, it did, Stokes did really well to get his fingers under the ball and grab it safely. England are just two away from bundling the hosts."

Big wicket and once again it is Sam Curran who has given Root the breakthrough. This young lad is some cricketer. His 4th wicket of the innings. Good length ball around off and shaping away. De Kock looks to defend it away from the body but the ball kisses the outside edge of the willow and goes straight into the mitts of Buttler. The 47-run stand is broken and England have a chance now to wrap this up and maybe even bat again for an over or two. There was no need for de Kock to have a feel of that but he still went for it and he will be gutted with himself to miss out on a deserving ton. He walks off to an applause from the crowd and his teammates alike. He has single-handedly taken the hosts to a very good, fighting total here. Quinton will not be happy having missed out on his personal milestone."

He ends up getting a thick outside edge which goes straight to the man at first slip. Joe Root there takes another simple catch, his third of the innings. They lost one of their reviews in the previous ball but it has not cost them a lot as he has struck gold in the very next ball. The 87-run stand is broken and England have their first wicket of the session."

The previous one came in to the right-hander, this one moves the other way. It is pitched on off, van der Dussen gets on his front foot and tries to play the classical front foot defense. The ball shapes away and finds the outside edge of the bat and goes straight towards first slip. England skipper, Joe Root there makes no mistake and takes a simple catch. Once again Curran gets the breakthrough. This young man has the knack of doing so and he is doing his reputation no harm. Not a long lasting start to his Test career for Rassie. Just 6 on his maiden outing."

However, Faf does not think much and signals for the review straightaway. Let's see what the replays show. No problems with the front foot. Now, the Ultra Edge, there is a spike on it as the ball passes the bat but it is not sure from where it is coming from as there is a gap between the bat and ball. Tricky call for the third umpire to make. Not out is the decision from the third umpire then. Looks like a correct call has been made."

Here, South Africa is hosting England for a 4-Test series with the first one starting on the historic Boxing Day. England have a few health issues with several players set to miss out this Test due to illness. For the hosts, Vernon Philander has announced that this series is going to be his last one. How will it pan out for him? How will 150th Test match pan out for James Anderson? We have plenty of questions that need answers. We will have them all in the course of this Test.

After wrapping up South Africa 10 minutes into the morning. The hosts started off badly losing both the openers early on.  Joe Root and Joe Denly then steadied the ship with a 55-run stand. Root though could not capitalise on their start. Stokes then continued the good work and at 142/3 it looked like England were in the driver's seat. But as has been the story with this English Test side one just cannot be confident. They are used to a collapse and that is what happened. The visitors started losing wickets left, right and centre and from 142/3 they have been bundled out for 181. Giving South Africa a head start of 103 heading into the 3rd innings."

Anrich Nortje then joined the act and his two quick wickets has seen South Africa head into Tea being in the driver's seat. So what do we have in store for the final session? Can England make a comeback or will South Africa wrap it up early in the final session? Join us after the break to find out."

The latter got to his fifty and with the score reading 142/3, it looked like England will easily head into Tea with their noses well and truly in front. But as we have witnessed so many times in the recent past, and England collapse was not far away. From 142/3 the visitors found themselves reeling at 150/6. They lost 3 wickets in the space of 16 balls and now find themselves in  a big spot of bother."

The ball shapes away just a bit. Stokes looks to defend but that little zip troubles him enough to take the outside edge and goes straight into the mitts of Quinton de Kock. The Proteas are up in joy and celebration. England's crisis man is out of here and he is gutted with himself as he knows technically he was well below par on that shot. The visitors trail by 134 and have just 4 wickets in hand now."

His search for his maiden Test ton continues. A superb ball from Pretorius. It is just ahead of the back of a length. It pitches and then comes back in as Denly comes forward and looks to defend. He misses to do so and the ball goes behind. De Kock takes the catch and makes a confident appeal along with the bowler. The umpire though is unmoved. After a brief chat, South Africa opt for the review and the replays detect the small spike as the ball gets closer to the bat. So, the on-field decision will be overturned."

A back of a length ball outside off, Denly pokes at it. The ball takes the outside edge and goes towards the first slip. De Kock throws himself to his right but cannot reach there. The ball goes in the hands of debutant Rassie but it quickly pops out. It went straight in so one would feel he should've had taken it. Probably the dive of de Kock distracted him there. It can be really costly because Denly can get himself in and play a really big knock."

However, after he takes the DRS, Sibley starts going off. He did not do that immediately but after the decision has been taken upstairs, he starts walking. The umpire there stops him, probably to get everything confirmed. Now, time for the replays, front foot is okay. And a clear spike on the Ultra Edge. So, now, please keep walking, Mr. Sibley. Coming to the ball, whatta ripper from Rabada. Back of a length ball around off, the right-hander has to play at it. Sibley hops and pokes at the ball but only manages an outside edge to the keeper. England are in all sorts of trouble early on."

He is one of the best bowler to left-handers and he has struck gold in the very second over here with a peach. Vernon bowls it on a length, in the channel of uncertainty. The ball goes with the angle but then straightens a bit. Rory looks to defend but gets a feather on it of his glove on its way to the keeper. De Kock takes it and goes up in celebration. Burns does not even wait for long and starts walking back. South Africa needed early wicket and they have got just that. Perfect start for Philander in his final series."

Full and swinging away from the southpaw. Burns looks to drive it straight but misses. There is a noise as the ball goes to the keeper. De Kock takes the catch and goes up in a confident appeal. The umpire agrees and raises his finger. Burns is unsure and has a word with his partner. After consulting Sibley, Rory signals the 'T'. Replay rolls in and it shows that the ball has missed the bat and the sound is of the bat hitting the pad. Ultra Edge rolls in and it shows that there is a very little spike as the ball goes past the bat but there is also a gap so the on-field decision has to be reversed."

Having lost both the openers early, they were stuttering at 165/5 but debutant Rassie van der Dussen and nightwatchman Anrich Nortje took the game away from the visitors with a 91-run stand. Rassie scored his maiden fifty but he could not last long. Anrich Nortje fell 10 short of his fifty. It looked like England could still wrap them up under 300 but Quinton de Kock's counter-attacking 34 took them close to 350. Vernon Philander was also good with the bat as his 46 and Rabada's quickfire 16 in the end took the hosts' lead to a commanding 375."

De Kock lunges forward and looks to defend but the ball tails away just a tad and kisses the outside edge of Quinton's willow. There is an appeal from the keeper and Stokes but surprisingly it is not a loud one. The bigger surprise is de Kock does not wait for umpire's decision and starts walking. This is very good sportsmanship from de Kock. In the age of DRS you hardly see players being honest and walk away without the umpire raising their finger. End of another counter-attacking knock from de Kock. He has been taking on the charge but surprisingly it's the defensive stroke that he has been dismissed off in both the innings. The lack of enthusiasm and energy from England after picking up that wicket does not put up a good sign. The lead is 323 now."

Illness to Joe Root and Jos Buttler has not helped their case as they look out of ideas out in the middle. The frustration in the English camp has been very much visible as Broad and Stokes got into an argument as well.

Carrying a lead of 175, Rassie van der Dussen and nightwatchman Anrich Nortje took the game to the visitors. They added a 91-run stand with Rassie getting to his maiden Test 50. The partnership finally was broken as Rassie was caught in front of the stumps. Anrich Nortje, soon followed him and fell for a very well played 40. Pretorius too did not last long but Quinton de Kock came out with a plan. His plan was to treat this red ball as the white ball of T20 and his quickfire and unbeaten 30 has seen the lead swell up to 300. The hosts still have 3 wickets in hand and with de Kock still out in the middle, expect it to go up even higher."

Jofra's pace finally gets the better of Anrich Nortje. It is quick and on the pads, Nortje looks to flick but the ball kisses his willow and then lobs off his pad towards short leg. Substitute Zak Crawley there takes an easy catch to bring an end to a wonderful innings from Nortje. Yes he has not scored a ton or even a fifty but he has played a gem of a knock here and has taken the gas out of the England players. He walks off to an applause from the crowd. The lead now stands at 273!"

In return they lost 4 wickets but still remain on top in this Test match. Aiden Markram has been ruled out of the series due to a fractured finger. The visitors are not out of this yet and if they can pick up the remaining wickets quickly and restrict the lead to around 225, they will feel that they are still in with a chance. Jofra Archer was the pick of the bowlers for England, picking up 2 wickets while Broad and Anderson picked 1 each. The first session will dictate terms because if South Africa can survive that, the lead might swell up to 250 and that will not be easy to chase. Can the visitors make a comeback in this game or will the Proteas continue to be on top? Join us in a while to find out."

It is not an easy wicket to bat on and at this point of time the hosts are on top. But if England can manage to wrap them up under the lead of 250 then it will certainly be game on. Who will dominate Day 3? Join us on Saturday, 28th December 2019 to find out. The play begins at 1000 Local (0800 GMT). Till then, cheers!"

Buttler behind the wicket makes a loud appeal but Archer goes up only after seeing Buttler appeal. The umpire shows no interest and England skipper does not opt for the review either."

Jofra thinks he has his man but Buttler does not believe it. Root, Archer and Jos have a brief chat but Buttler is sure there is nothing on it.

But Nasser Hussain. His constant praise about Faf playing the pull shot has actually jinxed the Protea skipper. 'He will let the short ball go if he is playing for the World XI. But he can also play the pull shot while featuring in the World XI.' He mentioned this twice in the span of 5 minutes and it has worked. The jinx. The trick. Either ways, if you live by the sword, you need to be prepared to die by it as well. The ploy to go after Archer has backfired. Could du Plessis have held himself back in these final few minutes? But then, when you are in overdrive, it is very difficult to get back into first gear. And that is exactly what has transpired. Quick and back of a length delivery on middle, Faf instinctively goes for the pull but takes his eyes off the ball. He is on a knee while trying to pull that. That looks good in T20s or while featuring in the death overs of an ODI innings. But in this format, it seems pretty audacious, to be honest. And invitation of extreme criticism if you fail to pull it off. Faf is not in control while playing the pull and as a result, the ball hits the top half of his bat. It is not cleanly struck and the ball goes towards deep backward square leg. Sam Curran comes running in from fine leg and takes a good catch. Faf shakes his head while smiling at the same time. Big mistake. Jofra wins the battle. Just conceded a few runs in the process but he has got his side in a realistic chance to win this game now. 165/4 is the effective score. If the lead can be restricted to 225, this could be a cracker of a finish."

But a brilliant delivery. It is a fullish ball around off, van der Dussen looks to defend but the ball moves away and takes a thick outside edge. It goes to the left of Ben Stokes at second slip who dives to his left for the catch and Curran celebrates. But Stokes is not sure if that is a clean one though as he gives a wry smile. Rassie is very much sure that he is not out and shakes his head. However, the umpires get together and refer it upstairs with the soft signal as OUT! Here come the replays. The first look indicates that the ball bounces just before it goes in the hand of Stokes there. The second look, the side-on one, shows some doubt. The third umpire is checking various angles. They are taking their time and now they confirm it to be short of Stokes, so van der Dussen survives."

Clear BOUNCE. Guess Stokes knew that the ball had not gone straight into the hands. As a fielder, you know when the ball goes straight in. The first replay, the front on one, shows the ball landed in front. However, looking at the side on angle, it is not exactly clear. Surely, when in doubt, go with the batsman. Not just umpire's call.

Elgar looks to defend but the ball comes back in a long way. It takes the inside edge of his defensive willow and goes over the stumps. Seems like it will race away to the fine leg fence but Jos Buttler dives to his right and takes a very good catch. Archer and Buttler put in an appeal and umpire Gaffaney raises his finger. Bang, bang, bang! The Proteas are effectively 132/3. Any chances of a reminiscence of the 2016 Jo'burg miracle? You never know with Broady and Archer..."

Ultra Edge confirms no involvement of bat. Where is it hitting? Hawk Eye rolls in, wow, crashing on the middle pole. Markram will not enjoy it when he sits down in the dressing room and sees the replays. Not sure how the Protea skipper will react either. Anyways, Anderson has struck for England in the first over, once again. Exactly the kind of start England would've wanted."

The South African players are up in celebration and England in troubled waters here. 144 runs more to win and South Africa just 4 wickets away from wrapping this up.

Zubayr Hamza there gets it in an awkward height but he hops and makes it look easy. Looks like he has hurt himself too with the new ball but at this moment it does not matter as South Africa have sent half the English side packing back into the pavilion. Joe Root looks helpless from the other end. Jonny's poor run in red ball cricket continues. 154 runs more needed and South Africa are on fire here."

Massive wicket in this game. No Ben Magic here in Centurion as Maharaj has got the king-sized wicket of Ben Stokes. Maharaj bowls it slightly short but on the rough. It puts Ben Stokes in two minds, whether to play at it or let it go. He tries to dab it down towards third man but the ball is too close to do it. The ball turns in a bit as well. It hits the glove and goes onto hit the stumps. The hosts are up in joy and the home fans are loving it too. Faf is up and pumping and this match has got another turn to it. 172 runs more needed and one might feel South Africa will have their energies up as they have got the big fish here. No Big Ben show so is this the end of this chase? England still have 6 wickets and their skipper is still out there in the middle but has Keshav delivered the body blow in the form of Stokes' wicket?"

The pressure the opening bowlers built is starting to pay off as the new bowlers are getting the breakthrough. A wicket that South Africa wanted. A wicket that South Africa have got. Both the well-set batsmen are out of here and South Africa on top here. Very good bowling from Pretorius. Good length ball pitching around off and coming back in. Denly looks to flick it across the line but misses. There is a huge appeal from the Proteas players and the umpire agrees with him and raises the finger. Joe Denly has a word with his skipper and then signals the 'T'. Replay rolls in and Hawk Eye shows that the pitching is not an issue. The impact is in line as well and the ball is clipping the leg pole. England retain their review but cannot overturn the on-field umpire's decision and England are in trouble here. They need 218 runs more to win but now have just the 7 wickets in hand."

The ball hurries onto Burns. He looks to pull it but he is very late in his shot. The ball hits the upper half of the bat and goes high in the air. It goes towards mid on. Rabada's eyes lit up looking at that but he does not lose his composure and he takes a good, simple catch. Burns' innings comes to an end. He misses out on a hundred but more importantly he was set and had to bat at least till Lunch. This changes the dynamics of the game here. First wicket of the day. South Africa need another 8 to win this. England need further 237. The match is back in balance."

The hosts need 9 wickets and are aware of England's habit of collapsing so they will still fancy themselves. The visitors, on the other hand, don't need to look too far away for inspiration as it was very recently that they chased down a mammoth total at Headingley. If that is not enough, the tourists must be aware of the hosts' behavior of tumbling under pressure. It's the last Sunday of 2019 and we are up for an exciting finish of international cricket for the year. Who are you backing to win this? Welcome to the coverage of Day 4 of this fascinating 1st Test between South Africa and England."

Burns got to his fifty and is still out there looking very good. He has been solid in his approach and has made most of the chance he got when Rassie van der Dussen put him down on 20.

Sibley gets on his back foot and looks to push it back to the bowler. He does so but uppishly and the ball goes straight back to Maharaj and he takes an easy catch. Sibley has had his struggles against left-arm spinners. He had a tough time against Santner in New Zealand and now Maharaj has got him. The solid opening stand is broken and South Africa are back in this game. 284 runs more needed and the hosts have found the source of inspiration they were looking for. CRASH. What was that? Oh dear... Sibley is angry. Very angry. Replays show the opener getting into the dressing room and throwing his helmet away in disgust. Tuk tuk... anger management and frustration control are needed. Anyone remember Matt Prior?"

But then, was it really a sitter? Imagine that you are playing a gaming console wherein you have to shoot at a target. You concentrate, aim and then fire. But suddenly, a bird flies out of nowhere just in front of the target. What are the chances of you missing your shot? Pretty close to 100 percent. Unless you are Orlando Bloom in Lord Of The Rings. But jokes apart, this was a very difficult chance for Rassie. Will explain why. Good length ball on middle and off, Burns looks to push at it but the ball moves away at the last moment. That squares him up totally and he gets an outside edge towards first slip. Now, it is a pretty straightforward chance to Rassie van der Dussen over there, to his right. But at that same moment, Quinton de Kock dives to his left to go for the catch. Understandably, that blinds Rassie, causing him to drop it. The ball drops down and goes into the fine leg fence for a boundary. How costly will that prove to be?"

England have had a tiring day so far in the field but they'll be happy that Burns and Sibley have successfully managed to see off 5 overs and the visitors go for Tea with all 10 wickets in hand. They need another 352 runs to win. It's a tough task but in no way it is impossible. They will need to bat out of their skin though and need to take it session by session. What do we have in store for the final session of Day 3? Join us after the break to find out."

Full delivery on off swinging into the batsman, Burns looks to push it but misses to get hit on the pads. The Proteas appeal and the umpire after some thought gives it out. Burns reviews it immediately. Hawk Eye shows that it is pitching in line but is going on to miss the off stump. Excellent review from Burns and will now look to make full use of the opportunity."
