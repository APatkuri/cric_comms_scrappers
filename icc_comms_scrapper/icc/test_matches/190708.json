The whole of Adelaide crowd is on its feet to applaud the knock of the genius. He bows down like an artist and soaks in all the applause.

Rizwan does really well to dive on that side and takes a good, good catch. Third wicket for Shaheen Afridi. He has been the only shining spot in this bowling unit.

David Warner got to his 200 and then rode some luck to get to his 250 before coming out unscathed to Tea with an unbeaten 261.

He just removes his helmet and raises his bat as everyone in the stadium applauds his effort. Coming to the ball, it is a good length ball on off, Warner looks to defend but it goes off the outside edge wide of second slip. The fielder cleans it up before the ropes. The batters take two."

He goes for a big drive but ends up getting a thick edge to the left of gully. It goes to Babar Azam who takes the catch. Pakistan cannot celebrate though as the umpire signals it as no ball.

Fuller around off, Marnus looks to drive it straight leaving a big gap between his bat and pad. The ball jags back in and goes right through the gate to uproot the off pole. End of a superb knock from Marnus Labuschagne. He will be gutted to miss out on a double ton but boy has this not been a gem of an innings to watch!  He walks off to a standing ovation from the crowd and he deserves every bit of it. The gigantic partnership of 361 has finally come to an end."

The duo got to their respective 50s and stretched their partnership to 131. 5 bowlers were used by the visitors with the spin duo of Iftikhar and Yasir Shah bowling just 5 overs. Shaheen was once again impressive but could not get the breakthrough. Will Australia end the day showing their dominance or will Pakistan finish the day on the front foot? Join us after the break to find out but before that David Warner is caught down for a quick chat."

He would be looking to convert this into another big one. Back of a length ball on off, Warner hops and looks to glance it to the on side. It goes behind square on the leg side after getting a thick inside edge. They look for two. The fielder has a shy at the bowler's end but misses. There is no one backing up and the fielder chasing it cannot stop it before the ball reaches the fence. He raises his bat and gets a hug from his partner. The crowd applaud his effort. 31st Test fifty for David Warner. He would look to convert this into another big daddy ton."

There is a big sound as the ball goes to the keeper. Shaheen Afridi and the keeper go up in a confident appeal. Rizwan thinks they have their man but after a brief discussion skipper Azhar Ali does not take the review. Good decision as Hot Spot later on shows there was no bat involved."

Only one ball nipped back in and that was the first ball that Burns played. He expects this one to come in as well but it does not. Joe looks to defend but gets a thick outside edge as the ball keeps its shape. It goes to the keeper. Rizwan moves to his right and takes a simple catch. Excellent start for the visitors."

Pakistan, on the other hand, are on a 13 game losing streak against Australia in Australia. A few changes are expected to ring in for this game with the confirmed news of Mohammad Abbas being slotted back in. Skipper, Azhar Ali has confirmed that he will bat at number 3. The question is who is going to open? Can Pakistan rise from the ashes and level the series or will Australia make it 14 wins against the touring nation? Stay tuned as the toss is not far  away."

Almost every Pakistani player is standing near the ropes. They too jump in joy. He pumps the air and then kisses the ground. What a wonderful moment this is. It would've been end of him though as the shot he played to get there could've easily gone in the hands of the mid on fielder. Good length ball on middle, Shah looks to loft it over mid on but mistimes it. Luckily for him, it lobs over and behind Cummins. He tries to stretch out his arm and get hold of it but he cannot reach there. Yasir is all smiles. He sways his bat and has a huge smile on his face."

The Aussies were not at their best in this session. Catches did not carry and Labuschagne was guilty of putting down an easy chance of Yasir Shah. Starc's double-wicket over though saw Australia get their Mojo back. Pakistan still trail by a massive 376 runs but Yasir Shah is continuing his battle. How long can the battle last? Join us after the break to find out."

Shaheen looks to flick but misses. It hits him flush on the pads. There is a huge appeal and the umpire raises his finger. Shaheen has a word with his partner and then signals the 'T'. Replay rolls in and first Hot Spot confirms no involvement of the bat. Hawk Eye then comes in and it shows all red. Shaheen has to walk back. Starc on a hat-trick now."

The Australian players and fans are ecstatic. Full and on the fourth stump line. Babar looks to go for a drive. He gets a thick outside edge which goes to the right of the keeper. Tim Paine dives on that side and takes a good single-handed catch."

As much as possible so that they can think of saving this Test. But if there's any side who can be absolutely shambolic one day and completely unbeatable the next then it's Pakistan. Australia, on the other hand, will look to continue what they have been doing in this game so far. They'd look to bundle out the tourists as quickly as possible and then either make them bat again or opt otherwise. The weather forecast for the day is not too good.

This is a short and wide delivery outside off, Iftikhar throws his bat at it but the ball goes off the outside edge and it is going towards first slip. Paine dives full stretch to his right, sticks one hand out and the ball stays in. Had he missed it, no one would have been able to take the rebound.

Get all the boundary riders in, pack the slip cordon and if in this process, a few boundaries go by, let them go! But with this field, hard to see a wicket coming off a good ball."

The umpires go upstairs to check whether it is a clean catch. The replays roll in and they show that Smith has taken it cleanly. Pakistan in deep trouble at the Adelaide Oval."

It looked like the Aussie would try and go past Brian Lara's world record score of 400 but Tim Paine called his side in when Warner went past Sir Don Bradman's score. With 589 runs on the board and the Pakistani players tired for fielding for a day and a half, Tim Paine would have hoped to get a wicket or two before the break. He did not get two but he certainly got one. Starc bowled fire balls and got rid of Imam before the break. Skipper Azhar Ali and Shan Masood will have a task in hand in the final session as the ball is relatively new and the strawberry has a tendency to move a bit under lights. Can Pakistan fight out the final session of the day with little to no damage or will Australia pile on the misery? Join us after the break to find out."

Well, both openers survive but straightaway, Australian new-ball bowlers are showing the length to be bowled on this track."

On his declaration before Warner's 400 chances, Paine says that they did think that and spoke to Warner about it but David was okay with the declaration. Talking about Labuschagne, Paine says that he is enjoying his success with the bat. On the bowling, Paine says that the wicket was a difficult one and the bowlers kept coming entire time and it was an awesome performance from them. On the upcoming three-Test match series, Paine jokes that he would want to pouch a few more catches than he did. Tells that if they continue on the path they are right now, the series will be an exciting one."

Australia's golden boy of 2019 has ended this Test match and series with a bull's eye. Fuller ball on off, Musa manages to hit it to the right of mid on. Abbas was going for a non-existent single and Musa sends him back. But Abbas is halfway down and the brilliance of Cummins finds him short. He is so short of his crease that the umpire does not even go upstairs. The Australian players are up in joy.

Nathan Lyon has bounced back from the disappointment of the first innings and was once again instrumental in cutting short Pakistan's stubborn fight by claiming a fifer. 2 wickets left to pick and the only question remains is whether Rizwan rallies around with the remaining batsmen and force Australia to bat again! We will find that out soon. Do join us in a short while for what could be the final session of this Test series."

Star of the session and this innings so far, Nathan Lyon is down for a quick chat before he heads for his break. Lyon says that it was a very good session and hopes they are clinical enough to wrap it up. On being unlucky not to get any wickets on Day 3 inspite of bowling so well, Lyon admits that is how it is. Further adds there are days you bowl badly and yet end up getting wickets."

Shorter and slightly quicker on off. It pitches and straightens. Yasir looks to play from the back foot but is late on it and the ball hits him flush on the pads. The Aussies appeal and the umpire raises his finger. Yasir makes eye-contact with Rizwan and then signals the 'T'. Replays roll in.  First Hot Spot shows that there is no involvement of the bat. Snicko confirms it later on. Ball Tracker then comes in and it reflects all reds. Yasir has to walk back. No heroics from him in the second innings. Pakistan still trail by 66 runs."

The latter got to his fifty and it looked like it would be a wicketless session but Lyon got rid of Shan. Asad too departed after getting to his fifty and once again it was the local boy who did the damage. Lyon must feel he should have had 3 as Labuschagne dropped his third catch of the game. This time it was of Rizwan. The visitors would hope that Rizwan and Iftikhar can put up a fight and show some grit. Can they do it? Join us after the break to find out."

Floated on middle and off, Shan comes down the track and looks to loft it over wide mid off. But he cannot get the elevation and ends up hitting it straight to Starc. The century stand is broken and Paine is jumping in joy. Pakistan still trail by 164 runs and will have to put in the hard yards again."

Babar missed out on a well deserved ton earlier in the day. That inspiring knock from Yasir failed to inspire the tourists top-order and after being forced to bat again, Pakistan lost 3 wickets including that of Babar Azam.

Fuller ball this time, it jags back in as Imam brings his bat down to put bat on ball. He misses and the ball thuds on the pads. A loud appeal from the Australian and the umpire raises his finger instantly. Imam goes towards Masood thinking about the DRS. They talk the entire 10 seconds and eventually decide against it. A right call that one as the replays roll in and shows that it was hitting the top of middle and leg. Exactly what the Aussies would've hoped after enforcing the follow-on. With the wicket, the umpires decide to go off for the DINNER BREAK."
