Or did Australia just simply play well? One would guess the third option. Looking at the 10 mm grass on the pitch, it would have been a no-brainer to field. The Kiwis bowled well throughout on Day 1 but they were kept at bay. It was only on Day 2 that their bowling let them down. Australia played traditional Test cricket, seeing off the new ball, batting patiently and scoring off the bad balls. Neil Wagner was the bowler who bowled with venom, even when things were not going for him or his team. He got 4 wickets with the best of those being the brute to Steven Smith and ironically, with one wicket left in the innings, it was Wagner who took the catch to have Australia bowled out."

But this is exactly the type of scorecard that any batting skipper would want. 5 consecutive 50-plus run stands from 1/1, with the last one reading 150. Yes, Steven Smith and Marnus Labuschagne scored but for a change, they were not the only ones. Warner played a very good hand in seeing off the new ball in testing conditions while Matthew Wade did well to ensure that there was no collapse after the Labuschagne dismissal."

Now, here is the interesting thing about the review. The men behind the stumps are not too keen about the referral but Wagner wants it. Williamson agrees and signals the 'T'. To the naked eye, the impact looks outside off and given that Paine has been hit on the knee roll, the height seems to be an issue as well. But here comes Ball Tracker. The impact is in line and the projection is shown to be hitting the stumps! Even Marais Erasmus is surprised by that. But Paine has to go after a wonderful knock. The 150-run stand has been broken at last."

Nicholls takes a few steps back, times his jump to perfection, stretches one hand upwards and takes it nicely. Wagner is pumped up.

Australia will be hoping the two carry on and set the platform for a big first innings score. The Kiwis on the other hand, aren't that far behind in the game, a couple of wickets early and they are right back into this.

We saw a wicket fall 15 minutes before Lunch and now a wicket 18 minutes before Tea. Labuschagne is disgusted as he walks back. New Zealand though rejoice. This is on a length and around off, this one comes back in sharply and there is also some extra bounce. Marnus looks to leave it alone but the ball hits the elbow and then hits the stumps behind. Marnus can't just believe what has happened. He has been leaving the ball so well but falls in that manner. A good innings by him comes to an end though. New Zealand are into the fragile middle order of the Aussies now. They will hope that this wicket opens the floodgates for them."

Williamson picks the ball up and has a shy at the bowler's end but misses. Kane probably could have waited for a second more and then thrown it to the bowler. Big chance this.

Warner was looking so comfortable out there but falls to an excellent one-handed reflex catch. The change of ends works brilliantly for Wagner. However, there was absolutely no foot movement by Warner. Maybe he was expecting Wagner to go short but Neil does the opposite. He goes full and gets it to move away from off. Warner pushes at it away from the body. It flies off the outside edge between first and second slip. Tim Southee at second slip dives with his right hand and then catches as it swings and wobbles in the air! End of a solid stand for the hosts. The visitors will now hope to get another before Lunch."

Australia though will probably be the happier side at the moment as they have only lost the one wicket in testing conditions. Labuschagne and Warner are now looking good and are amidst a good stand. New Zealand on the other hand, are bowling well, getting the ball to move around but are not getting the breakthrough. That is what they will be looking for after the short break. Will they get it? We will have to wait to find out."

Burns looks to drive it down the ground but fails to adjust to the movement. The ball sneaks between the gap of bat and pad and hits the stumps behind. The Kiwis are pumped up and Burns bags a first-baller. Also, seeing that delivery, the new ball is really going to test the Australian top order."

Given that they have bowled a shade over 50 overs, a follow-on might be on the cards."

Paine has a chat with the umpire and rightly so, replays did suggest that it brushed the wrist band which is a part of the glove but the third umpire feels different. It is a short one and on the body. Santner looks to fend it by taking his eyes off the ball. It goes off some part of the arm towards Head at leg gully. He takes it and there is an appeal. The umpire shakes his head. After a discussion between short leg, silly point and the keeper, Paine reviews. Quite a few replays have been watched. It seems to indicate that the ball has hit the wrist band. However, Aleem Dar gives it in the favor of the batter. It was a tough decision so can't blame the umpire there. Australia lose a review."

He has been steaming in from yesterday, desperate to make his presence felt and he gets his second scalp. This is absolutely unplayable. Pattinson bends his back and lands this back of a length outside off. BJ is forced to play at it but suddenly, the ball kicks off. It keeps on rising and takes the glove, lobbing to Joe Burns at first slip. 3/12 in 32 balls this morning."

Nicholls shuffles right across and misses the flick shot. He is hit flush on the front pad right in front of the stumps. A huge shout and up goes the finger. HN reviews. Replays roll in and they show that the on-field call is the right one. JUST ABOUT. Because the impact is in line but the angle is taking the ball down the leg side, clipping the leg stump on height as per Ball Tracker! Nicholls trudges back, New Zealand do not lose a review though. Cummins is on a hat-trick for the 8TH TIME in his Test career."

Taylor pushes at it with hard hands. It goes off the outside edge. It goes quickly towards Labuschagne at third slip who is quite low in his stance. He stretches his arms upwards to take the catch but fails to hang on. The ball though pops up just behind first slip. Burns is alert to that, he moves towards the ball and takes it. The Australians are delighted. Early wicket for them, just the start they would have wanted."

The ball lobs towards gully where Warner dives forward and takes it. A huge appeal but the umpire is unmoved. There is a discussion between the Australians but they do not review. Rightly so as replays show there is not bat and Ball Tracker shows it to be going over. End of a testing first over by Cummins."

Burns looks to run it down fine but it is a little too close to the ball to play that shot. It brushes the glove and goes into the mitts of the keeper. There is an appeal, Burns stood his ground, the umpire did not raise his finger but eventually did. Maybe Erasmus thought the edge was pretty obvious and Burns would walk but that did not happen. He had to lift his finger in the end. Burns walks back after a start and Santner gets his first."

Hopes to improve those come Sydney. On difficulty in winning in Australia. Willy admits that it is difficult and being against a very good opposition can be even more challenging. But also says that the team needs to rise and learn from mistakes. On Wagner's lion-hearted performance, Kane smiles and says that he never gets tired of bowling. Lauds Blundell as well for registering a Boxing Day century. Wishes that his team can start converting its starts and get partnerships."

However, it was too much of an ask and one task which was impossible for a single player to complete. Also, 4th innings, 4th Day so you would expect Lyon to come to the fore. That was the case as he was the pick of the bowlers as he finished with a four-fer."

Blundell now decides to turn and run to the non-striker's end. In the end both are running to the bowler's end. Pattinson from point gets to the ball and then throws it to the keeper who whips the bails off. Australia now a wicket away and Lyon needs one for a fifer."

Came in the side for the under-performing Raval and has grabbed the opportunity with both hands. He gets there by working this full ball on middle through mid-wicket for one.

Perfect delivery for his type. First, he gives this plenty of air and seeing that Watling is lured into the drive. He lunges but the ball pitches, landing on the rough created by the footmarks and then spins back in. Takes the inside edge and goes through the gap between bat and pad towards leg slip. Now, credit has to go to Warner here. He would have been blinded but he reacts as swiftly as anyone possibly can and takes a good catch! Made that look simple but trust us, no catch is easy off an inside edge. Australia celebrate but no one appeals. Watling walks off anyway and then umpire Erasmus raises his finger. End of a 72-run stand."

So he starts to run backwards now, aiming to cut the ball sideways at some point. But that point never comes. The ball meets the ropes and so does Head. 50 UP FOR NEW ZEALAND."

Paine however, is seen having a discussion with the umpire as he feels there could have been one more over bowled. Nevertheless, it has been a tremendous session for the Aussies. Three wickets after declaring and that too Williamson, Taylor and Latham - they just could not have asked for anything better. However, the Kiwi openers started off really well, they looked solid and determined. The introduction of Pattinson though changed things as he ran havoc and blew away the top order. All Australia now need is someone to support Pattinson and they and we could have a day off tomorrow. The Kiwis need a big stand, a mammoth effort from the batters to salvage something out of this game. Their first aim will be to go wicketless in the next session. Can they do so? We will have to wait to find out."

Australia won't care at all though as they have got the big fish for a duck, he slowly trudges back as he knows his team needed a mammoth effort from him. He does not take a review along though. Pattinson gets the opposition's skipper twice now. This lands on middle and then angles into the pads. Williamson looks to flick but misses to get hit on the pads. An appeal and up goes the finger quickly. Kane reviews after a chat with his partner and then goes for the review. Replays roll in and it shows the ball to be clipping the leg pole but only by JUST! Two wickets down now and both for Pattinson. Still some time left before Lunch, can Australia get another?"

Almost a carbon copy of the way he got out in the first innings but this is an even poorer delivery. It is full and wider outside off, Latham goes after it but the ball kisses the outside edge and goes low to the left of Paine who dives and takes it. The bowling change works wonders and Pattinson strikes in his first over itself. However, Latham is the one to be blamed here. He is such a good leaver of the cricket ball, not sure why did he go after this one and not once but in both the innings he has been dismissed on deliveries which should have been left. Maybe this time around he got bogged down by Cummins, he finally sensed an opportunity to score and went after it and paid the price. The budding opening stand has been cut short."

An early let off, one can say for Blundell. Can he make use of this life? This is probably the kind of a let off a batter who is in need of some runs need."
