With that mystical number, Anderson carves his name into history books and enters the Mount Rushmore of greatest ever Test bowlers. It has been a frustrating wait from wicket 598 to 600 but he has got it. Azhar Ali becomes a milestone victim for Jimmy and his expressions have changed. He is up in joy and has the ball in hand and waves it to the empty stands but all his teammates applaud. Finally Anderson gets a bit of help from the slip. Anderson bowls it in the channel of uncertainty around off, the ball bounces a bit off the surface which takes Azhar by surprise. He looks to defend it with a horizontal bat but the extra bounce surprises Azhar, takes the outside edge of his bat and goes to Root at widish first slip. The England skipper makes no mistakes and takes the catch. A perfect role model for all the youngsters in the world watching this game. Anderson has aged like a fine wine!",True,11678,,
