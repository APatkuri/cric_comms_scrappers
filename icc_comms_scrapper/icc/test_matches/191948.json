Join us in a while for Pakistan's first innings."

All the credit has to be given to Crawley and Buttler though. The hosts were in trouble at one stage, before Crawley and Buttler joined hands. From thereon, it was all England. Crawley and Buttler stitched a 359-run partnership before Crawley fell for a magnificent 267. Buttler fell for 152 and Woakes and the lower order added a few valuable runs before Root declared. They are on top of this game and will hope to take a wicket or two before the end of play."

Can you believe that a part-timer has got the wicket of a batsman who was in his 260s? Finally, Pakistan have something to cheer about. Shafiq bowls a floated ball down the leg side, Crawley comes down the track and looks to flick. He misses. Rizwan moves to his left, collects the ball and whips the bails off. Crawley was not even in the picture. Crawley is walking off to a huge round of applause from not only his teammates but also from the Pakistani dressing room."

Luckily for him, it goes past the diving second slip fielder and into the fence. He might have had his heart in his mouth but is a relieved man and raises his bat to his teammates. Crawley becomes the third youngest player for England to score a double century in Tests."

Crawley and Buttler played cautiously and scored only 41, with the latter reaching his second Test ton. Crawley has struggled for timing a little and he will look to reach his milestone in the next session."

Buttler is disappointed and he reviews. The Ultra Edge rolls in and it shows that the noise was of the bat hitting the bat and there was daylight between the bat and the ball. What a relief for Jos Buttler!"

They will look to add some quick runs and take England to a total above 450 which will be a huge total on this wicket.

The umpire is not interested. Azhar takes the review. The Ultra Edge rolls in and it shows that there is nothing on it. Azhar and the umpire are involved in a laugh after the decision."

Yasir Shah has been terrific in this series so far and he is doing the job again for his side. Pope had to play Yasir on the front foot and he does not and that brings about his downfall. Quicker delivery on off, Pope is on the back foot to defend but misses and the ball goes onto hit the off stump. The leg spinner had dismissed Pope in the same manner in the second Test match and has got him again. Lovely."

Just around off and on the good length. Root looks to defend but the away movement means the ball takes a thick outside edge and goes to the right of the keeper. It is in front of the first slip fielder but Rizwan moves to his right and pouches it nicely. Good looking stand is broken again by Pakistan before it grow big."

A massive appeal follows and the umpire raises his finger after taking his sweet time. Sibley and Crawley get together and refer it upstairs. The replays roll in and the Ultra Edge detects no bat. And, it is three reds on the Ball Tracker so Sibley has to go. He takes a review along with him. Pakistan break the threatening stand."

This time the ball takes a thick outside edge and goes to Shan Masood at fourth slip. He gets down and pouches the catch. Burns is not sure if that carried but Masood signals it's out.

Will there be any changes in the personnel for this game? Will Anderson get to 600 Test wickets in this game or will we get to witness a Babar special? Too many questions. We will find the answers in the course of this game. Stay with us for the toss and team updates."

Good length ball on middle, Ali pushes it uppishly towards mid on where Broad makes a mess of an easy catch. Ali who wants the single takes off but Abbas who is watching the ball is late to take off. Broad collects the ball and has a shy at the keeper's end and hits. No need for the third umpire as Abbas was well out of the crease. Broad apologizes to Anderson after that."

A lot of pressure heading into the Test, chips were down when he came out to bat but like a true leader he has shown his troops how to fight and battle it out in the middle and given his side a glimmer of hope. A much-needed century for him. He gets to his 17th Test ton in style. Floated delivery on off, Azhar gets on his front foot and drives it through covers for a boundary. He raises his bat, removes his helmet and has a huge smile on his face. His teammates are up on their feet and he looks at the sky.  The job is not done though and he will need to carry on his effort."

Pakistan lost Fawad Alam in this session but the skipper has led the fight and showed heart. Azhar Ali and Mohammad Rizwan, the last recognized batting pair, have done really well adding 83 runs and seeing out the session without any further damage. The skipper is 18 short of a well-deserved century but the tunnel is still dark in this Test match for the visitors. England will be satisfied if not too pleased with their efforts. They have plenty of runs to play with and would look to end this stand early in the final session and enter the tourists' tail. A tough session awaits Pakistan. Can they stage a big fight? Expect the unexpected from the mercurial Asian side. Join us at 1615 local (1515 GMT) for the final session to find out."

The openers took their time and with some luck built a 49-run stand. Azhar Ali then joined Abid and the pair did what they had to do, eat away the balls and ensure they get closer to rain. Abid's 162 balls 42 helped them get closer. Azhar Ali and Babar Azam then ensured there were no more damage at the end of Day 4 before rain came down heavily and killed all hopes of an England win on Day 5. The final day became more of a formality and about Anderson's unbelievable milestone which he got when he got rid of the Pakistan skipper. Asad failed to make the most of the formal day and got out to another low score before both sides decided that a result was not possible. Not much to talk about England's bowling. It was hard and they tried their best. Archer and Bess bowled their hearts out but to no success. Anderson got his 599th and 600th wicket while Root and Broad finished with one to their name."

The duo stitched together a 138-run stand and ate away a lot of deliveries. Azhar stayed unbeaten on 141, though that was not enough to avoid the follow-on but it was good enough to drag the game to days which had rain forecasted. The fine-wine, Anderson was the star for the England side as he finished with yet another 5-wicket haul. His partner-in-crime, Stuart Broad finished with 2 while Woakes and Bess had one apiece."

Joins an elite list of Muttiah Muralitharan, Shane Warne and Anil Kumble to become only the 4th player and the first pace bowler to get 600 Test wickets. What a milestone! Take a bow legend! With that mystical number, Anderson carves his name into history books and enters the Mount Rushmore of greatest ever Test bowlers. It has been a frustrating wait from wicket 598 to 600 but he has got it. Azhar Ali becomes a milestone victim for Jimmy and his expressions have changed. He is up in joy and has the ball in hand and waves it to the empty stands but all his teammates applaud. Finally Anderson gets a bit of help from the slip. Anderson bowls it in the channel of uncertainty around off, the ball bounces a bit off the surface which takes Azhar by surprise. He looks to defend it with a horizontal bat but the extra bounce surprises Azhar, takes the outside edge of his bat and goes to Root at widish first slip. The England skipper makes no mistakes and takes the catch. A perfect role model for all the youngsters in the world watching this game. Anderson has aged like a fine wine!"

With the ball getting softer and the pitch getting easier to bat on, the hosts' bowling struggled to get the breakthroughs. The 38-year old though finally managed to get to 599 wickets later on in the day but his wait for victim number 600 goes on. Tough day for all the bowlers in a nutshell as the pace has gone off the pitch."

They have lost just 2 wickets and will enter the final day with 8 wickets in hand. Shan Masood and Abid Ali started the day with a fighting stand of 49. The former was given a lifeline early in the innings by Jos Buttler who dropped a sitter. Though Masood did not score much, he did eat away 66 balls. Abid was then joined by his skipper and the pair fought on, playing some classical Test match cricket. Abid though became Anderson's 599th Test victim. The Pakistan Test skipper, Azhar Ali and the T20I skipper, Babar Azam then ensured there was no further damage before dark clouds and bad light came to the tourists' rescue."

Can he get to 600 wickets before Stumps? This is terrific bowling from Anderson and he is pumped up. Good length ball on middle and leg, Abid looks to flick but misses and gets hit on the pads. England appeal and Michael Gough, the on-field umpire, raises the dreaded finger. Abid consults his partner and takes the review. The Ultra Edge rolls in and is shows no bat on it while the Ball Tracker shows umpire's call on hitting the stumps. Abid Ali played really well and fought really hard but it has ended and he has to walk back. Review retained."

This partnership comes to an end but needed to continue. Masood showed promise but fails to carry on. Good length ball around off, angling in. Masood looks to leave it alone but gets rapped on the pads. England appeal and the umpire raises his dreaded finger. Masood thinks for a while and signals for the 'T'. The Ball Tracker rolls in and it shows that it is umpire's call on hitting the stumps. The impact will not matter as there was no shot played. Masood has to walk back. Pakistan do not lose the review. England are 9 wickets away."
