Ishant finally fell when the score was 260 and Shami followed him soon after. Jadeja went on to counter-attack and reached his 11th fifty in the meantime. India have scored 297 runs which is a respectable total on this wicket."

The two left-handers can go bonkers from ball one and add quick runs for the Indians to take them towards a strong total. Or, bat long and hard, tire out the home side and take the total close to 300 without being separated. West Indies will look to get rid of this pair and then look to get through the tail. Also, we will be starting 30 minutes from the routine time to cover the lost overs of Thursday. Join us on Friday, 23rd August, 2019 at 9 am local (1300 GMT). Till then, goodbye!"

Ajinkya Rahane survived two scares before he reached his half ton as he was dropped on alternate balls by Miguel Cummins and Shai Hope respectively. After KL's departure, Vihari walked in and looked pretty solid out in the middle adding a 41-run stand with Ajinkya Rahane. Do come back and join us as we resume the third session on Day 1."

The ball goes further down the leg side, Hope follows it and takes a good catch. Rahul is gone and just short of his half ton. Rahul looks very disappointed as he leaves the pitch and he should be as well as this was a nothing ball. The 68-run stand between Rahane and Rahul is broken and the hosts get a much-needed wicket."

And, if the three wickets which fell accounts Indian skipper Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara among them in single digits, one can understand who was on top early on. However, KL Rahul has looked fluent while Rahane has dug in well to add 43 runs between them. With this strong looking stand, one would feel that both the sides go to Lunch with confidence. When we come back after the break, Windies will look to break this grooming stand while the Indians would want the runs to keep flowing in the second session. We'll be back in a while."

                    "Commentary": "NOT OUT! However, the review has been retained by India. The umpire signaled not out but the ball is clipping the top of middle and leg. This one is pitched on a good length around off, the ball nips back in with the angle and hits Holder on the back pad and carries to Pant after that. Jason is on the front foot and maybe it's his big stature that the umpire takes into account as the Indian players are denied after a loud appeal. After a bit of consideration with Shami, Kohli goes for the review. Ultra Edge comes in and shows no bat involved. Now comes the Ball Tracker, pitched outside off, impact in line, clipping the top of middle and leg. Umpire's call and Holder survives. India though retain the review."

Good length ball on around off, Bravo looks to flick but he misses and is hit on the pads. Bumrah and the Indian team make an appeal and the umpire raises his finger after taking his time. Replays roll in with Ultra Edge confirming no bat involved. And then, Ball Tracker comes in and it confirms the decision of the umpire that the ball was shattering into the middle and leg stump. Great decision by the umpire there. The Windies have lost their first review. Number 50 for Bumrah in Test match cricket."

A brilliant innings by him comes to an end and he is dismissed for 102. He has done well to put India in a dominating position as they lead by 397. The 135-run stand has been broken here."

Rahane played cautiously and is 10 short of completing his tenth Test match ton. The West Indies bowlers have not bowled well and given runs away cheaply. Two of their pacers are in the dugout with some injury issues and the hosts will be hoping that they come back and join them after the Lunch break. Do come back and join us for the second session of Day 4."

Mayank would be feeling unlucky here but on the first instance it looked to be crashing into the stumps. India lose their first wicket with 30 runs on the board."

Kohli also says that they are pretty settled in the pace attack with Yadav and Saini in the ranks. The important thing is sharing the work load. As a part timer Hanuma Vihari does well and can bowl some quick overs and can manage the over rate if needed. Says that Vihari's inclusion was based on team combination and adds that everyone is in the loop during such decisions. On being asked about the role of captaincy, he says it is a responsibility that he is fulfilling and he credits his players for the performances.

He adds that playing regular Test cricket has helped him a lot. On being asked about the wicket, Jasprit says it was on the flatter side. Kartik asks Bumrah about what the conversations are between the trio of fast bowlers (Him, Shami and Ishant) Bumrah responds that they communicate a lot between them. They suggest each other just to bowl in the good areas even if they are not getting wickets. On being asked some competition with himself after a bit of disappointment in the first innings, Bumrah says it was nothing as such. He was feeling a little sore in the back after returning from the break. Murali thanks him jokingly about earning everyone a one day break."

The victory is almost inevitable now as the Indians will be looking to end this match today itself and seal the victory. Join us for the third session as it might as well prove to be the last one of the match."

He picks the ball up and has a shy at the bowler's end which hits. There is a run out appeal out of nowhere which has been taken to the TV umpire. However, Kohli was heard saying that Brathwaite's bat never went out of the crease as per Murali Kartik on air. The batsman is safe as he plonked his bat in. Risky but Kraigg survives."
