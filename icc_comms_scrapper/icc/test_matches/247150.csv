Almost a reminiscence of the Cheteshwar Pujara dismissal against Australia at The Adelaide Oval in the first Test in 2018, when Pat Cummins scored a direct hit from mid on to catch Pujara short at the bowling end. The batter and opposition are different this time but the result and the subsequent questions regarding the run precisely the same. In both cases, the call was questionable from the batter and the fielder was a fast bowler. Was the call made probably because Kohli felt that Henry might have been resting on his heels? And basically, was this run necessary at this stage of the day? Not sure. Kohli perishes too after a boundary. This is going from bad to worse now for India. A run out just at the brink of Stumps and Virat Kohli is absolutely animated with himself. Fuller in length, and at the stumps. Kohli got on the front foot and pushed it to mid on, calling through for a quick single. Matt Henry, at mid on was quick to pick and throw in a motion and scored a terrific direct hit at the non-striker's end. Kohli was compelled to put in a full-length dive to get home. The Kiwis started to celebrate and the decision was referred upstairs. The TV umpire confirms that Kohli's bat was just a foot outside the crease when the stumps were hit. It was Kohli's call so no one else could be really blamed. Heartbreaking last 15 minutes or so for India as they have now slipped from a comfortable 78/1 to a precarious 84/4.

NEW ZEALAND BLANK INDIA OUT IN THIS 3-MATCH TEST SERIES AND EXECUTE A DOMINATING CLEAN SWEEP! History has been scripted at the Wankhede Stadium and probably the greatest Test series win in the history of New Zealand cricket. And this is the first ever time when India has been whitewashed in a 3-match Test series on their home soil. Absolute pin-drop silence in the stadium but exactly contradictory scenes in the visitors' camp as their joy knows no bounds. Coming to the delivery, Ajaz Patel bowls it from over the stumps, and tosses this one up. Full in length, outside off, and it lands right on the rough and spins back in viciously. Washington Sundar sits down to access the slog sweep but the turn gets the better of him. He gets no bat on it and the ball disturbs the furniture. Ajaz Patel finish off with a spectacular 6-for but this has been a complete team performance by the Blackcaps.
