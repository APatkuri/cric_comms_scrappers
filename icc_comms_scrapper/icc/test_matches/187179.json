His call at the toss started to bother the Aussies after the first two sessions of this Test but then powered by Mitchell Marsh's stupendous reverse swing bowling, Australia made a resounding comeback. Rory Burns and Joe Root (with three lives) were the only notable contributors from the English top order and if it was not for Jos Buttler's superb batting and his handy partnership with Jack Leach, the hosts would not have managed even 250. Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood once again bowled with a lot of heart and they would have loved the presence of Mitchell Marsh to share their responsibility. Nathan Lyon wasn't needed much in this innings but might be required for a bigger role next time. Good rest for his injured fingers."

A top replacement this one. ENGLAND ALL OUT FOR 294."

The all-rounder then relentlessly got stuck into a nice rhythm and with his spell of 8-3-17-3, he completely turned the tide in Australia's favour. Going comfortably at 170/3, England slipped to 226/8 and started to stare down the barrel. However, Jos Buttler received good support from Jack Leach and Jos unleashed on the tired Aussie bowlers. His 64 off 84 balls has pushed the home side's score close to the 300-run mark and the English team would be hoping for a big knock from him on Day 2."

Tim Paine won the toss and to the surprise of many, he chose to field first. After picking just one wicket and dropping Joe Root twice in the morning session, soon it looked like Paine will be regretting his decision. England batted well in the afternoon session, in spite of losing two wickets, and the pair of Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow started to settle down into a good partnership."

Woakes has a short talk with his partner Buttler but he advises him against taking the review. Woakes starts taking the long walk back. The Ball Tracker confirms that the umpire was right as the ball is hitting the bottom of middle and leg. The change of bringing in Mitchell Marsh for Travis Head in the playing XI has worked wonders for the visitors as he has picked up a 4-fer already."

A length ball, around off, Root looks to defend but this one pitches around middle and off and then nips away a bit. The ball stays low as well, goes past the outside edge and knocks the off stump back. This is exactly similar to the way Cummins got Root on the fourth evening of the Manchester Test. Root does not want to go. He is busy gardening the pitch! Now, he has a look at the replays and starts to walk back."

He has absorbed the pressure, taken everything in his stride and is now opening up slowly. Gets there with a late nudge towards fine leg, running hard for the second. To be honest, the danger period begins now for him. He has scores of 57, 71 and 77 this series and if any complaint comes against him, it is his poor conversion rate into a century. Not a bad time to ask for that present from the kangaroo-styled Santa Claus today."

He looked a touch nervous after that catch and Labuschagne consoles him. Replays now show that Stokes turned a full 360 degrees after playing that shot. He had no idea where the ball went, did not want to have an idea either, as he just stormed off. Assuming that the fielder would take the catch. If he were Root, he might have watched till the end, just in case even that went down. Australia would be happy with their progress post Lunch."

He bowls this one on a back of a length and just outside off, getting it to nip away with some extra bounce. Root plays at it after going onto his toes but gets a thick outside edge on it. It's going almost straight towards Warner at first slip but Paine intervenes with a leap to his right. He tries to take it with one hand but puts it down. Had he left it for Warner, he might have taken it with ease as it was looking a much easier catch for David. Root is hanging on by the skin of his teeth here and the Aussies will be hoping that this does not come back to haunt them."

Short ball by Cummins on the off pole line, Root pulls it uppishly towards fine leg off the top edge. Siddle is stationed there and the ball goes to the right of him. He runs across, stretches both his hands out but it bursts through. It's almost chest height but the ball pops out of his hands and slips onto the ground. The batters take one and the English skipper survives. Costly miss."

Earlier, his trigger movement of dragging the back foot used to be nice and calm and the front foot used to be on its toe, loading into the shot. But in this series, he is hurriedly going back in his trigger movement and is getting stuck on the back foot as his front foot gets settled before he leans into his shot. So, by the time the ball comes, he is already late to execute anything. Slight chink in his technique and the English skipper will have to get it corrected."

It's all Denly's fault that he goes chasing after a length ball outside off. We have talked earlier also about his inability to restrain himself. Goes for a booming drive away from his body only to get a thick outside edge behind. It travels at a nice height at second slip where Smith reacts to catch it but starts to lose his balance. The ball pops out of his hands first time but then it sticks near his chest and Steven tries to catch it on the second attempt. By now, he is already down on his knees but still fails to catch the ball. On the third attempt, Smudge finally cups it much to the delight of Pat Cummins. Joe departs soon after England posted the best opening partnership of this Ashes."

Smith shuffles across in his usual manner, trying to flick the ball towards the leg side but unusually, he misses his flick this time and is hit on the pads. He is caught dead in front of the stumps. The English players appeal and umpire Erasmus raises his finger straightaway. Steven Smith has a talk with Peter Siddle at the other end and he advises him against taking the review. Wise decision as the Ball Tracker shows three reds. Australia still trail by another 107 runs with just 2 wickets in hand."

Cummins, however goes for the review after consulting Smith at the other end. Will that help? Let's see. Nothing on the Ultra Edge. Here comes the Ball Tracker.

Paine goes to push it down the ground with a straight bat but the away movement means the ball takes the outside edge and goes straight to Bairstow. Smith is running out of partners here."

However, he does not get the best connection on it and it goes high between first and second slip fielders. Joe Root at first slip jumps high and to his right, gets two hands to it but puts it down. Smith is dropped on 66 and he gets a life. A very good news for Australia but not so much for England."

The ball hits Wade on the front pad and the English players appeal. Kumar Dharmasena takes his time and raises the dreaded finger. Wade goes for the review straightaway. The replays roll in and the Ultra Edge shows no bat. The Ball Tracker comes into play and this one is CLIPPING the leg pole. Umpire's call it is and thus, Australia retain their review. Sam Curran picks up his first Ashes wicket and he will be delighted. Australia 4 down and they trail by 176."

After having a chat with his mates, Joe Root goes for the review. Ultra Edge comes into play, there is a spike as the ball passes the bat but the third umpire wants to have a look at the Ball Tracker also. On the third umpire's wish, the Ball Tracker comes into play. It shows that the ball is missing the off pole. England lose their review but one must think that why did the umpire go to the Ball Tracker if there was a spike as the ball went past the bat. Hmm...

This one is a similar delivery to the previous one, good length ball just outside off and nipping back in. This time Labuschagne misses his flick altogether and is hit flush on the pads. The English players all go up together for the appeal and umpire Erasmus agrees. Labuschagne walks up to his partner Steven Smith, has a long extended chat with him but eventually decides against taking the review as the time also runs out. Ball Tracker confirms that the umpire's decision is right as it shows three reds. The threatening 69-run stand is broken and this might be the window that the hosts were craving for."

Harris too soon followed him back to the pavilion and since then, Labuschagne and Smith have tried to weather the storm. The pair has looked largely untroubled although Sam Curran has tested them with his left-arm angle. The current pair has built an unbeaten 41-run stand and will be looking to continue the good work against the English bowlers in the second session. On the other hand, England would be hoping to get at least one of them out, if not both, as soon as possible and then make further inroads into the Australian batting line-up. Do join us at 1340 local (1240 GMT) for all the action."

There was only a muted appeal there by Bairstow and Stokes was just seen clapping. No one picked anything. But the Ultra Edge did. There was a spike. Big miss for England.

Two outside edges fell short of the gully fielder but the third one goes straight to second slip. Stokes is superb in holding on to this one, very close to the ground. It is a good length ball closer to the off pole, Harris is squared up as he looks to block but the ball straightens a bit from there to take the outside edge. It flies to Stokes at second slip who takes it very low by going down. Australia have again started the innings very badly and need a big partnership now. David Warner is taking away all the criticism for his poor form and that has somehow protected Marcus Harris who has been equally poor in this series. Unlike Warner though, his time is running out with a few vying his spot in the Playing XI."

The slip cordon instantly appeals but there is nothing much from Bairstow. He appeals after seeing the others appealing. Root goes for the review after thinking for a while. The naked eye does not show much, as there seems to be a gap between bat and ball. The Ultra Edge is taking ages to arrive. Finally, it does and there's a tickle as the ball gets closer to the bat. Almost at the toe end. Warner has to walk back. For a change, not to Broad. He walks off with loud boos from the crowd. His poor run in the series continues. Exactly the kind of start the hosts would've wanted."

No idea. Then Atherton asks who is the other man out. He is then informed about Joe Denly. What a feeling for the proud papa.

Australia were average throughout but in the last session of Day 3, they managed to pick 6 wickets to restrict England's charge somewhat. Nathan Lyon starred for them with a 4-wicket haul but the amount of turn he got from the surface will be bothering the Aussie batsmen already. Let's see how they approach the chase."

Lyon tosses this one outside off, Leach gets down on one knee and goes for the slog sweep towards long on. But he top edges it and the ball balloons towards the left of mid on. Hazlewood moves across in that direction and gobbles it up before falling down in the process. The visitors have stopped England from crossing the 400-run mark and now the match relies on the Australian batters."

However, the task of chasing down such a big total is not a single person's job and he will need more than enough support from the other end. If there was ever a moment that Australia wanted David Warner to step up, this is it! Will it happen? Or will the Aussie batting order crumble under the pressure and fall apart?

Not a great delivery to be honest but Pat won't mind. He bowls it on a good length but this one goes down the leg side. Curran goes for the flick but this time he does get a fine tickle on it as the ball goes to the right of Paine behind the wickets. He dives across and holds onto a fine catch. A good grab from the Aussie skipper. England lead by 348 runs with 4 wickets in hand."

Buttler was also out LBW but Australia opted not to take a review and that is why he is still on the crease along with Sam Curran. They will be looking to come out all guns blazing after the Drinks break while the visitors will be looking to continue on their wicket-taking momentum."

It goes low towards the left of Steven Smith at first slip where he takes a very good low catch. Paine did dive to his right and that might have blind-sided Smith a bit but he still hung onto it. There was a doubt in the umpire's minds as to whether that was a clean catch or not. Jonny also holds his ground in hope. The two umpires get together before going upstairs. The soft signal is given as out. The third umpire looks at the replays and agrees with the on field decision. The hosts lose their fifth wicket and a mini-collapse looks to be on the cards here. Lead is 318 runs!"

This is a touch fuller and just outside off, this time Siddle gets it to straighten a shade. Denly has a poke inside the line and edges it behind. It brushes Paine's pads and loops up to Steven Smith who is stationed at first slip. No mistake this time by Smudge. Denly has to take the long walk back to the pavilion. He is looking disappointed but the crowd is giving him a standing ovation. He has done a great job for his team and put the hosts in a commanding position in this match. England are just 9 runs short of taking their lead to the 300-run mark."

Denly takes a step down the track and looks to flick but misses. Siddle and the Australian players appeal but nothing from the umpire. They opt against taking the review. Replays roll in and the Ultra Edge shows no bat. Ball Tracker comes in now and shows that this was missing leg. Good decision by the umpire."

Stokes is completely squared up by this one and it beats the outside edge of his blade before meeting the stumps. A sensational delivery to get rid of Stokes but is it too late for Australia? Appears so. England are right now effectively 283/3."

Joe Denly and Ben Stokes are amidst a century stand and that has propelled the Three Lions. Australia tried hard but without any success. They did have a couple of chances to dismiss both the current batsmen but failed to take that. Ben Stokes was dropped on 7 by Steven Smith and then the lbw appeal of Joe Denly was not referred by Tim Paine when he was out. The visitors have themselves to blame for all these things. Currently staring down the barrel, the Aussie would be still hopeful of bouncing back in the evening session just like on the first day. Let's see if they succeed. Do join us at 1600 local (1500 GMT)."

The duo has added 48 runs between them and would want to continue going upwards. Australians have not looked threatening. Interestingly, Marsh, their star bowler of the first innings has just bowled 4 overs until now. He returned to trouble the batters. He had Denly plumb in front of the wickets but the umpire didn't agree with him and the Aussie skipper didn't go for the review either. Also, Stokes has been dropped off the bowling of Nathan Lyon by Steven Smith. One thing everyone can agree on is that Australia are not taking the chances that fall their way. How costly will that turn out to be? Let us see."

Marsh along with his teammates put in a loud appeal but the umpire has denied it. Tim Paine has a long chat with his bowler but decides against the review. Now with 2 reviews in hand, they might as well should have gone for it. Replays roll in, Ultra Edge confirms no bat. Ball Tracker now comes in and shows THREE REDS! Australia have missed a trick here as Denly is going good and it looks like luck is on his side too."

This delivery is nothing special from Lyon, just like his last wicket. He pitches this one way outside off and gets it to spin back in a little. Root goes far too ahead in an attempt to put bat on ball but gets an outside edge instead on it which goes straight to Smith at first slip. He won't drop those. England are effectively 156/2 and Lyon is the man with both the wickets until now. Root's mediocre Ashes with the bat comes to a close."

The openers were dismissed cheaply and Labuschagne and the modern day 'Don' Steven Smith rescued the Kangaroos from embarrassment. The middle order failed to perform and the third top scorer for the Men Down Under was Nathan Lyon as he scored some valuable runs in the end to reduce the deficit to 69. The standout performer for England was Jofra Archer as he took his second 6-fer in the series but one must also mention Sam Curran who brought in a different dimension to the hosts' bowling lineup and troubled the batters a lot on his way to a 3-fer. In the final moments of the last session, Australia had the chance to get off to the perfect start to disrupt England's plans for Day 3 but Marcus Harris dropped a sitter to dismiss Joe Denly. A great day of Test cricket awaits us, stay tuned and join us in a while for the coverage."

Marnus Labuschagne and Steven Smith formed a partnership to steady the ship but then the former departed and the latter kept on losing partners. Smudge was eventually dismissed late in the evening session on 80, apparently his lowest score in this Ashes, and after a quickfire knock by Nathan Lyon, the Australian innings got folded."

The Australian players appeal loudly following the miss and umpire Dharmasena agrees as he raises his finger. However, Burns is convinced that he is not out and straightaway signals the 'T'. Replays roll in, Ultra Edge confirms no bat involved. Ball Tracker comes into play and shows that this has pitched outside leg. Successful review for England and they head into STUMPS ON DAY 2 at 9/0, leading by 78 runs."

He tries to take it with his fingers pointing up but it pops out and goes behind for a run. Denly has been dismissed in similar fashion throughout this series and the edge should not have come as a shock to Harris at gully.

Though Australia retained the Ashes they could not take the series trophy home. The Aussies now go back to their homes before they welcome Sri Lanka for the T20Is starting 27th October. England's stay at home comes to an end as they fly to New Zealand for their next assignment. They too begin their tour with a T20I series starting November 1st. It was a great pleasure bringing you the coverage of this mouthwatering series. Hope you enjoyed our coverage as much as we did bringing it to you. Join us again as more cricket comes your way.

Credits his bowlers for their performance. Laughs and says he is always 50-50 during the toss as he cannot read pitches. On the series being drawn, Paine admits that this game dampens that but he is still happy and says they are satisfied with retaining the urn as it has not happened for almost 20 years. Tim says that it is a competitive game especially Tests between England and Australia. Credits Wade for his innings and tells it was a great knock. Tim admits that he is enjoying to lead this side and he feels that there is still some unfinished business with this side. Paine tells they spoke about doing something that had not been done for a while and they wanted to enjoy the reception from the Barmy Army and not succumb under it."

On Jofra, he says he was good and ably backed by other talented bowlers. Root thinks they have shown great character. Credits Tim Paine and his side for the way they played. On being asked about the continuous flopping opening combination, Root admits that they need to work on that but also adds that it was tough to play against Australia on difficult pitches especially against a quality attack. Thanks Trevor Bayliss for improving England cricket in all formats and for his effort. On Stokes and Bayliss' relation, Root says that players build up a relation over a period of time and thinks what Stokes and Bayliss have is really special. Root is confident that they can challenge Australia in a couple of years time in their own backyard and feels that he has the squad to do that. Ends by saying that he feels blessed with the players he has and thinks the World Cup was a remarkable moment."

The English players jump up in joy and Marsh starts walking off but umpire Dharmasena tells him to wait as he wants to check for overstepping. The umpire goes upstairs and the replays show that Woakes has overstepped to give Marsh a lifeline."

Smith shuffles like his usual self and looks to flick it fine. It comes off the upper half of his bat and goes to the left of leg slip. Ben Stokes there is standing fine. He dives across to his left and takes a very good low catch. The English players are up in joy and what a beautiful sight this is if you are an English fan. Steven Smith walking back before raising his bat. A rare sight."

Warner looks to defend but just like Holding (on air) said earlier, he does so away from the body by going at the delivery. The ball takes the outside edge and goes to the right of third slip. Burns there takes a very good catch in front of second slip. The tale of the series continues as both the Australian openers are back for an early shower. This is the 12th time Broad has got the better of Warner in Tests, 7 of those have come in this series. Broad's Bunny!"

Broad bowls it full on off coming from around the wicket. The ball comes in with the angle and then moves away. Harris looks to defend but the away movement squares Harris all ends up and he has to hear the terrible noise of the stumps rattling out of the place. The off stump is off for a walk and Broad is up and running. Another left-hander is a victim of England's ace bowler. Australia need 381 runs."
