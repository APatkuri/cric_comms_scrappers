The ball takes the top edge and goes way in the air towards short fine leg. Watling calls for the catch, settles under it and gobbles it comfortably. A fighting innings from Pujara but he will be kicking himself for the way that he departs."

The ball takes the glove and goes towards the keeper where BJ Watling gobbles it and appeals and the umpire gives it out. Vihari departs after a promising knock and a good stand is broken.

Southee and the rest appeal and the umpire obliges with them as he raises the dreaded finger. Kohli discusses with Pujara and then decides to go for the review at the last moment. The Ultra Edge rolls in and it shows that there is no bat on it. The Ball Tracker shows that it will go onto hit the middle stump. Excellent start to the session for the Kiwis."

They would have been happier if they had not lost the wicket of Prithvi Shaw in the later half of the session. They started positively in this session with Shaw going all guns blazing at the start. Mayank Agarwal lost his wicket to Boult but then Shaw and Pujara stitched a good 50-run stand before Shaw was out to a brilliant catch from Tom Latham. Pujara has been defensive and has been joined by the Indian skipper, Virat Kohli who has looked good so far."

The Ultra Edge and the Snickometer is shown to check whether there was any bat on it. No bat shows the replays. Is it surprising? No, Pujara had left the ball so there was a rare chance that it will hit the bat. The Ball Tracker rolls in and it shows that the ball was going over the stumps. New Zealand lose their review."

The session started with Bumrah picking two in one over to peg the Kiwis further back in the game. It looked like India was cruising towards a decent lead but de Grandhomme, Jamieson and Wagner made sure the Kiwis came closer to the Indian total. Jamieson once again missed out on his maiden Test half ton."

Bumrah this time convinces his skipper to go for the review. Time for the replays. Front foot is checked first. It is a legal ball. There is no inside edge which is confirmed by the Ultra Edge. Is it hitting the stumps? No, going over the stumps. India lose one of their reviews."

The soft signal is out. They check the front foot first. It is fine. Now towards the business end.

The ball goes high in the air behind point. Yadav from point runs behind and takes a brilliant tumbling catch. He kept his eyes on the ball till then and swallowed it in the end. A needless shot from the experienced campaigner."

The Kiwi bowlers even after being attacked, kept things tight and managed to get breakthroughs at regular intervals. A collapse came soon and the hosts were folded for 242. The Indian bowlers had 23 overs to make amends of their batters' poor show but they failed to get any wickets as Latham and Blundell dug in and looked solid in their 63-run unbeaten stand. Welcome to our coverage on Day 2 of the game. The  Indian bowlers will be hoping to turn this around in the morning session of the game while the hosts will be looking to get closer to the Indian total without much damage. Let's see which team takes the honors of winning the 2nd Day."

Pujara though got himself in and added important 81 runs with Vihari. Both the batters reached their half tons but threw their wickets away. The score soon read 194/5 to 242/10."

Boult collects the ball and fires the throw at the bowler's end but he misses. However, Williamson collects the throw and whips the bails quickly to find Bumrah short.

Vihari and Pant will return on Day 3 and try to score as many as they can. They will also hope for runs from the lower order too. What about the hosts? They will look to quickly get the remaining wickets and then chase the smallest of targets. What does Day 3 hold? Join us on 2nd March 2020 at 1130 local (2230 GMT, Previous day) to find out. Till then, goodbye and take care."

He got hit on the helmet, took a few on the gloves and then ended up dragging one onto the stumps. Then Pujara fell to a peach from Boult. And now, India are in a spot of bother."

He has been put off by the bouncers so all he is expecting is another bouncer. This one from Wagner does not rise much but Rahane has already moved in the position of playing a pull. He realizes the pull short is not on so he tries to help it to fine leg but ends up cannoning the ball onto the stumps off his pads. Brilliant stuff from Wagner. He kept bowling the bouncers and has finally got the reward."

Now, Colin de Grandhomme joins the list to dismiss Virat Kohli in this series. De Grandhomme lands one a bit fuller and around off and gets it to jag back into the batter. Kohli is committed to defend it but the ball swings in enough to beat his bat and hit the pads. There is a huge appeal and the umpire gives the marching orders for Kohli. Virat starts walking before looking at Pujara who asks him whether he wants to review it but he says something and then keeps walking. Replays later show that it was a good decision to not review it as the ball was crashing into the leg pole. He had made a poor DRS call in the first innings and didn't do it this time around."

Now the cricketing action moves ahead with New Zealand touring their neighbours Australia for a 3-match ODI series which starts on 13th March. India, on the other hand, welcome South Africa for the 3-match ODI series which starts on 12th March. Hope to have your company for those games. Till then take care, cheers and goodbye!"

It is bowled on a length and on off, It is a nip backer as Blundell looks to defend it leaving a big gap between his bat and pad. The ball sneaks through that gap and hits the top of off pole to send it for a cartwheel. The umpire stops the batter as they check for the no ball. The replays roll in and it shows that Bumrah has some part of his heel behind the popping crease. The third umpire to be completely sure sees the replay a few more times and then gives the marching orders for Blundell."

Will India end up putting a fight with the ball here or will New Zealand continue their dominance? All the questions will be answered shortly.

In the hour earlier they bundled out India for just 124 as the Indian batting's sorry tale continued. India lost their last 4 wickets quickly as they could add only 34 runs to their overnight score. They could not stand a chance against the New Zealand bowlers as they made them dance to their tunes. Then came New Zealand's chance with the  bat as they started their innings in pursuit of the target of 132. The Kiwi openers have looked at ease as compared to their Indian batters as they have already eaten up 46 runs from the target. Indian bowling has been good in patches as Bumrah and Shami have made the ball talk but the luck has not favoured them. Yadav has been disappointing as he has dished out more on the pads and failed to maintain consistent lines and lengths."
