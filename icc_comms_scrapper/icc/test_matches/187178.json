The ball takes the outside edge and goes straight to Ben Stokes at first slip. Smith walks back but umpire Dharmasena wants a second look upstairs for the no ball. Here come the replays. The foot has landed outside the crease with the heel in the air, but on the line! England drop their heads down immediately on looking at the giant screen but Root gathers his team together and calms his players down. Very, very good job done."

It goes past him and the man from short mid-wicket rushes after it. By that time, two runs are taken. Smith takes his helmet off and soaks in the applause from the dressing room. The 1940s saw the dawn of THAT Don. The 2000s are seeing the dawn of THIS Don. Take a bow, Mr. rightly-called Precocious."

Adds that numerous times, the ball has beaten the bat but still, Root has kept men at square leg, fine leg, mid-wicket and mid on. 'Why?' asks the great man. 'Forget the on side! Make them play outside off, stop the runs and then force them to go through the on side.' Fair call. You are asking the bowlers to bowl on one spot but giving the field in the other direction."

There was a second on offer but Head takes a slow start. Also, he has to run around the bowler, so when he turns for the second, he realizes that he cannot make it to the striker's end in time. So he sends Smith back. Michael Atherton on air informs that Jack Leach is a left-hand batsman, left-arm bowler but he throws with his right hand. Interesting."

Their 116-run stand put England on the back foot and at one stage, the run rate was touching 4, which prompted Root to bring on Leach to stall the run flow. Did not make too much of a difference as the run rate has not gone down too much."

Broad is charging in midway but Labuschagne says he cannot help it. The bails now fall down at the non-striker's end. Oh dear... this is hilarious. The umpire puts the bails back at the bowler's end but now, the bails at Labuschagne's end go down! The batsman himself has to put it on. Now, umpire Kumar Dharmasena does a sensible thing. he walks across to Labuschagne and takes the bails off. So at the striker's end, the stumps are without bails. Broad is amused."

England appeal but Stokes immediately signals going down the leg side. Root comes forward for a chat with his champion who is on his haunches in frustration but eventually takes the review. Here comes Ball Tracker. Clipping the leg stump! Review retained. Erasmus smiles. Looked to be going down leg to the naked eye but had Erasmus given it out, Labuschagne would have been out of here."

Harris is not totally convinced that this would hit the stumps. He has a chat with Labuschagne at the non-striker's end and goes for the review at the last second. Ultra Edge comes in and shows no edge on that. Ball Tracker comes in now, pitching outside off, impact in line and wickets CLIPPING! It is just touching the top of middle and leg poles and thus it is Umpire's call. Australia in a spot of bother now."

A length delivery wide outside off, could have been left alone but Warner wants to play at it. Wants to have a feel. Then, he realizes that this is just the first over and he can let it go. Too late. The ball takes the toe end and goes behind to Jonny Bairstow. One down in the opening over! This is the 10th time that Broad has dismissed Warner, most by any bowler.

He casually says that the umpires need to be aware of how many reviews each team have. He points out that Australia have none but England have 2. So, he could have given it out and let England challenge it. Nasser is not too impressed with that suggestion. He reckons that the umpires have enough on their plate to focus on how many reviews either team has. He feels Erasmus would have felt it going down the leg side, hence gave it not out."

Australians were without reviews then. They are without review even now. Fuller ball on middle, Leach looks to flick but misses and is hit on the pads. Starc along with the entire team appeal but Erasmus deems this in the favour of Leach and England. However, had the Australians not wasted the review, they would've had closed this innings as the Ball Tracker shows that this was going to hit the leg pole. Lucky Leach, once again though."

England on the other hand, hoped for another Stokes heroics but he was done by a beauty from Starc. He had earlier broken through the defense of Jonny Bairstow to break the good-looking stand between him and Stokes. Buttler has raced along to 26 off just 34 balls and he is the only hope for the hosts if they are to initially avoid the follow-on and then add important runs further. Broad has got barrage of bouncers and has survived the same to remain intact at LUNCH."

Another excellent delivery. The new ball is working wonders for the left-arm pacer. This is an outswinger. It is on a length and around off. Stokes goes back and tries to defend but the ball goes off the outside edge straight to Smith at second slip. He makes no mistake. Australia are ecstatic. Into the bowling all-rounders now are the Aussies. 55 more needed for England to avoid the follow-on. 3 wickets in hand."

Also, it is a much-needed wicket for him, he has not been at his best but that delivery is one which Starc at the top of his game use to bowl. He sets up Bairstow by angling the previous two deliveries away from off. This time, Starc pitches this one fuller and around off, it tails back in late. Bairstow may have been a bit surprised by the movement, he ends up playing all around it, it sneaks through the gate and shatters the stumps. Early wicket for Australia, just what they wanted. The new ball does the trick for them. England still need 70 to avoid the follow-on. 4 wickets in hand."

That pair batted more than one session and it seemed like both would score a ton as the ball just wasn't doing anything and it seemed like a batting paradise. However, all of that changed after the final Drinks break. Cummins got the ball talking and created quite a few problems for Root and Burns. He did not take a wicket in that spell but created the pressure on them. Hazlewood though reaped rewards of that pressure created. He got Root, Burns and Roy in quick succession. From  166 for 2, England ended up being 196 for 5. Bairstow and Stokes were under the pump before the umpires offered them the light which they took gleefully. Tim Paine was not a happy man as he had to walk off as Australia then had momentum on their side but they had to do so."

However, there is not a lot he could have done here. This lands just outside off and it jags back in sharply. Root looks to defend off the back foot but the ball stays low. He misses and is hit right in front of the pad. An appeal and up goes the finger. Root walks back straightaway as he knows he is a goner. Hazlewood gets him once again. Both the batters who were batting nicely are back in the hut."

Burns misses out on his ton by 19 runs. Once again excellent use of the angle by Hazlewood. It is on a length and around off, going away with the angle. Burns looks to defend but does so inside the line. It goes off the outside edge towards second slip where Smith takes a good catch. Second wicket for Josh and Australia would hope, this opens the floodgates. England trail by another 331 runs."

Root looks to work it on the leg side but due to the movement, it goes off the outside edge in between keeper and Warner who fail to react and it goes to the third man fence. Maybe, the two failed to react as they did not expect an outside edge there as Root looked to play it on the leg side."

England however, think that it has hit him on the glove and they go for the review. The replays roll in and show that it has hit him on the forearm. The umpire wants to check for the LBW and thus the Ball Tracker comes in. The impact is outside off and Wade easily survives. No wonder he was as confident as it seemed even before the appeal was made."

The umpire agrees and sends him packing. He though consults with Smith and eventually goes for the review. This looks close, very close. The Ultra Edge shows no spike. Height maybe? Here comes the Ball Tracker. It shows that the ball was just clipping the top of middle. They retain the review but Marnus is a goner. No half ton for him here, first time it has happened for him in this Ashes. Australia in all sorts of trouble early on."

Broad comes steaming in from around the wicket just like he did in the first innings. He lands it on off and it is slightly fuller, it jags back in. Harris looks to play it with a straight bat but misses and is hit flush on the front pad. An appeal and up goes the finger. Marcus walks up to his partner and after a chat reviews. Replays roll in and they show that the on-field call is the right one. Australia lose a review. Things going good for England at the moment."

Once again, Labuschagne lands it in the rough outside off. It pitches and turns back in sharply. Leach looks to work it on the leg side but due to the extra bounce, it hits the handle and lobs towards Wade who takes it nicely at short leg. Australians are elated. One wicket away now and 91 balls to go."

The Australian players put in a loud appeal in the meantime but it is turned down. Marnus Labuschagne at short leg is extremely confident and indicates to Paine that there is no bat involved and wants it to be reviewed. Paine looks at him, then the bowler and does review. First, the Ultra Edge is checked. No bat. But where is Ball Tracker? Coming, coming, coming, coming, after a full whole minute, it arrives! Impact in line, but missing leg."

The umpire agrees. Lyon and Australia celebrate. Archer thinks of the review but Overton suggests not to go for it. Archer walks back with a wry smile. Nothing he could've done about this one. Probably not worth reviewing at all. This was a grubber. Barely bounced. What does Ball Tracker show? Impact umpire's call but the ball crashing into the stumps. Review would have been retained but Jofra would have still been out. Just two wickets away are the Australians from retaining the Ashes."

He has been leaving the ball brilliantly till now. This time though maybe he misreads the length. Josh bowls this very full and it starts just outside off.

He once again sets the batter up nicely. After a couple of outswingers, he gets this one to come back in a long way from outside off. Overton seems to have missed it and gets hit on the pads. A huge appeal and up goes the finger. Overton signals the 'T' and straightaway says that he has hit that. A huge cheer as the crowd sees the first replay as it seems there is an inside edge. The umpire is not sure as the bat also hits the pad before. Several replays are seen and then, the third umpire is confused and does not have enough evidence to overturn the decision. Time for the Ball Tracker now which shows the impact to be outside off. Once again a huge cheer by the crowd."

It was pitched on a good length and came back in sharply. Bairstow wanted to work it down the leg side but was hit flush on the pads. A huge appeal follows and umpire Dharmasena agrees with the Aussies. Bairstow though sends it upstairs after having a look at Buttler at the non-striker's end but he has to walk back. Second time Starc gets him in his Test and the 8th overall - most by any bowler against Jonny."

There is a lot of bounce on it. Denly goes back and tries to defend but the ball hits the handle and lobs towards short leg where Labuschagne takes a dolly. Early wicket for Australia after the break. Also, the visitors will hope, that wicket works wonders for Lyon."

He is once again the man doing it for Australia. This is shortish and on off, Stokes initially looks to defend but then tries to leave it on length. Too late by then though as the ball hits the bottom part of the inside edge and goes to the right of Paine. He takes it with a dive and appeals, it is a very confident one. The umpire is unmoved but what do we see? Stokes walks. Australia are ecstatic. England in trouble now. Australia just 6 wickets away. They would hope to take another before Lunch.

Cummins bowls it just outside off and on a length. Roy lunges and tries to push at it but leaves a gap between bat and pad. The ball tails back in, goes between the gap and hits the stumps behind. Also, credit to Paine for the last minute change. Starc was ready to bowl but in the end, he got Cummins on and that has worked wonders. Roy walks back after getting off to a start."

Regarding the strokes, it could be to try and put Nathan Lyon off. Remember, he has been struggling in the last 4 innings with the ball. So A. Play strokes to get Lyon off. B. By playing strokes, ensure that one does not get into a defensive mode as happened in the first Test."

The first session is a very crucial one so stay tuned for it. Welcome to the coverage."
