England will need to fight back, the conditions are good for bowling and they do have the attack which can trouble the tourists. Can England bowlers bring their side back in the game and help them end the day on a high or will West Indies dominate Day 2? Join us for the final session of Day 2 to find out."

Stokes' decision to bat first raised eyebrows and after looking at their display it seems to have backfired. A lot of the batsmen got starts but none of them could hang in there and make it count. Skipper, Stokes was the highest scorer but just like his teammates, could not convert it and could not lead from the front. A fight from Dom Bess at the end has given the English score some respectability and taken them over 200."

Excellent bowling performance from West Indies and their skipper has once again led from the front. This time with the ball, his movement and pitching with the ball has absolutely rattled the English batsman, Gabriel too was dangerous and the pair have taken all 10 wickets between them. All-in-all a great bowling display from the tourists. They will be delighted with their performance."

Him and Holder have shared all 10 wickets and it has been an excellent bowling performance from the West Indian bowlers. Along with his skipper, Shannon was the best bowler from the side. He bowls this length ball on off, Anderson misreads it and looks to defend. The ball sneaks past the bat and hits the off stump. But this partnership helped England reach over 200. ENGLAND HAVE BEEN BOWLED OUT FOR 204."

Everything he has touched has turned to gold, be it with the ball in hand or his reviews, he's been spot on. Slightly fuller ball on off, angling in sharply, Archer looks to flick but gets rapped on the pads. Holder appeals but is turned down. He thinks for a review and after consulting his teammates, Jason opts for the review. The Ultra Edge shows that there is no bat on it. What about Ball Tracker? It shows all reds and Holder has got his 5th wicket. England are just 2 wickets away from being bowled out."

A good innings from Stokes comes to an end and the budding partnership has been broken. Roach and Brooks will be relieved as their dropped catches has not cost West Indies a lot. Excellent delivery from Holder. He comes around the wicket and bowls it full around off, Stokes looks to work it to the leg side but the ball comes in and straightens enough to kiss the outside edge and go straight into the mitts of Shane Dowrich behind the stumps. He makes no mistake and the West Indies players are ecstatic. They are in command of this game and are into the bowlers now."

Ahhh... they must be booing the English from home. 87 is considered as an unlucky number for Australia but in the recent past, it has been England who have been facing more bad luck at that number in cricket. 5 down and still a quarter of an hour to go to Lunch. England are in tatters here. If Holder was looking rusty on Day 1, he has been the complete opposite bowler today! This bloke was looking so good - Ollie Pope. But that is what happens when you get some confidence. You don't quite want to let balls go, which you should, more often than not in a Test inning. That too, when you have faced just a dozen balls. Pope sees this length delivery around off and thinks, 'Well, let me just nurdle it around the corner for one.' What happens instead is the ball moves away, takes the outside edge as Pope looks to control the damage after realising the late movement but is too late. Outside edge to Dowrich and West Indies get another one. Shake of the head from Pope but mate, this is one ball which you could have left alone."

Brilliant stuff from the Windies. Zak Crawley does not make use of the opportunity given to him in the absence of Joe Root. Another batsman succumbs to the movement of the ball with his own feet not moving. Full delivery around off, which swings in sharply. Crawley looks to flick but misses and gets rapped on the pads. Holder and the rest appeal but the umpire shakes his head. Kettleborough gets across sideways to see where the ball has ended up, does an 'ooo' with his mouth but shakes his head. Holder is confident and goes for the review. Before the Ultra Edge rolls in, initially there is some confusion. Has the ball deflected off the bat? Nope. No deviation or spike on the Ultra Edge. The Ball Tracker shows all reds and Zak has to go. England are in deep trouble in their first innings and need their captain Ben Stokes to step up. But the question is - how will he play now? Take your side till Lunch without any more wickets or counter-attack?"

He actually makes half a movement across, then plays it from the crease. And then, he completes the shot after the ball has gone past. Which is why, he faces a lot of issues to indippers and inswingers."

It is pacy and pitches outside off, this one nips back in sharply. Denly looks to defend but the ball goes right between the gate of the bat and pad to disturb the stumps. Fast bowler's delight and second wicket for Gabriel. He has looked excellent so far in this Test."

Just 17.4 overs were bowled on Day 1 but the good news is that the weather is better this morning, although overcast, and we should get a prompt start. England, after losing the wicket of Dom Sibley early on in the innings, were helped by Burns and Denly as they managed to survive the burst of the West Indian bowlers before bad light and rain stopped play. Going into Day 2, Burns and Denly would want to continue their good work and not throw away their starts. West Indies, on the other hand, will want to take early wickets and push the hosts on the back foot. Roach and Gabriel bowled very well but Holder and Joseph looked a little out of touch. There might be interruptions again due to the bad weather but let us stay positive and wish for a full day's play.  We will have extended play to try and make up for the overs lost on Day 1. Who will take the first charge in this Test? Stay tuned to find out..."

Not the kind of return cricketing fans around the world would have wanted. It was a day which was dominated by showers and we had just 17.4 overs of action after Stokes, in his maiden game as Test captain, won the toss and elected to bat. In the little play we had, West Indies did manage to strike once, getting rid of Sibley. Denly and Burns then steadied the ship and would look to continue their partnership on Thursday. Let's hope that the rain stays away on Day 2 and we have a full day's action. Do join us at 1100 Local (1000 GMT) for all the updates. Till then, stay safe and take care!"

Burns was lucky to survive his rustiness but lady luck does not smile brightly on Sibley as his error in judgement has ended his innings. First international wicket after more than 110 days. A moment Gabriel and many will remember but Sibley would like to forget. He walks back for a duck. Terrific start for West Indies."

Enough of reading and listening to the unfortunate news. Let's just switch off from everything and concentrate on this beautiful Test match coming our way. England versus West Indies at the Rose Bowl. The players from both sides have trained well in the past few weeks and are ready for the challenge of Test cricket. Ben Stokes will be leading the English unit in the absence of Joe Root and let's see how he responds to his regular skipper's message of 'do it your way!' Jason Holder, on the other hand, has grown in stature as the Test captain of West Indies and will be looking forward to this assignment. These two teams are packed with some seriously great and promising bowlers whereas their batting appears to be on the lighter side. Having said that, England have the experience of playing in their own backyard and it's up to the West Indian batsmen to acclimatize. Stay tuned, we'll be with you every step of the way. We hope you're excited."

Stokes dishes a short ball around middle, Holder goes for the pull but does not time it well. It goes way up in the air and towards fine leg. Archer runs after it from fine leg and dives forward to take a good catch. West Indies lose their 7th wicket and they lead by 77 runs. Can England bowl them out before they reach a lead of 100?"

England desperately needed a wicket and they have got it. Once again it is Anderson who has done the damage. He has been the best bowler for England and Stokes so far. Anderson bowls a good length delivery on off, it is bowled at a good pace and nips back in. Chase looks to defend but misses and gets hit around the knee roll of his front pad. The England players put in an appeal but the umpire is unmoved. Anderson, Stokes and Buttler all have a quick chat after which Stokes signals the 'T'. Anderson's foot is fine so we move onto Ultra Edge and there is no spike there. Is height going to be an issue? No, it's not as Ball Tracker comes in and shows all reds as the ball is going on to hit the middle and leg pole. Chase's vigilant knock comes to an end and England get the wicket they were craving for. End of an excellent partnership as well which has taken West Indies in the driver's seat. They lead by 63 runs."

With the second new ball available straight after Tea, the Three Lions will be very hopeful of doing that. What's in store for us in the final session? Join us at 1615 Local (1515 GMT) to find out."

Anderson has been exceptional since the Lunch break and has been rewarded with a wicket. Good length ball outside off, Brooks looks to defend without moving his feet and ends up edging it behind. Buttler takes it comfortably and all of England players appeal. The umpire raises his dreaded finger after giving it a thought. Surprisingly, Brooks consults his partner who convinces him to go for a review. Anderson's front foot is fine and Ultra Edge shows that there is a spike on it as the ball passes the bat. Brooks has to go and he takes the review with him as well. England needed this wicket as West Indies are inching closer to wiping off the deficit."

A very good batting effort from Brathwaite has seen the tourists score 102 runs in this session and have lost just 2 wickets, with both overnight batsmen back in the hut. The tourists now just trail by 45 runs. England have had a tough game so far and they are clearly chasing this one. They will need to find a way to keep West Indies' lead to a minimum as at this point they are dictating the game. The hosts haven't found it easy as the conditions today have been the best to bat in the three days so far. Can England find a way to impress in this Test post Lunch or will West Indies continue their dominance? Join us for the second session at 1340 Local (1240 GMT) to find out."

Brathwaite looks to flick but misses and gets hit on the pads. England appeal and after a thought, the on-field umpire raises his finger. Brathwaite has a  chat with Brooks and at the eleventh hour signals the 'T'. Replay rolls in and Stokes, unlike Archer, has not overstepped his line. The Ultra Edge then rolls in and it shows that there is no bat involved. The Ball Tracker comes up and shows that it is umpire's call on impact as well on hitting the stumps. Game of margins this and West Indies won't lose their review but they will lose their man."

He knows the job is not done and he will look to make this count and convert this into a hundred. He gets to his 18th fifty by stroking this short ball from Bess towards point for a single. No crowd to applaud his effort in the stadium but all the West Indies' fans will be happy with it, that's for sure."

He bowls it on a length around off, Brathwaite looks to defend but the ball goes in between his bat and pad towards Buttler. There was a noise as the ball passed the bat and England appeal. The umpire shakes his head. England after some thought opt for the review. The Ultra Edge rolls in and it shows that there is no bat on it. In fact, it has touched the back pad before going through to the keeper. Contrasting luck for both the skippers so far with the DRS. Holder was spot on with his but Stokes has taken one and a poor one to be honest. The hosts lose their first review out of three. Anderson though will be happy with the line and the hint of moment on this one and would like to hit it there consistently."

England appeal and once again the on-field umpire raises the finger. Campbell goes for the review yet again but this time he is not so lucky as the Ultra Edge shows that there is no bat on it. The Ball Tracker then rolls in and it shows all reds. Campbell has to go now and the streak of West Indies' successful reviews is over."

On the saliva ban, he says he did it almost a couple of times but is happy not to have done it. Tells that they had to rub the ball hard.

Campbell has a long thought with his partner Kraigg Brathwaite and decides to review at the last moment. The Ultra Edge shows no bat but the Ball Tracker shows that it is pitching outside leg and Campbell survives. Excellent decision to review and West Indies' streak of successful reviews continues."

Jofra Archer and Mark Wood added few runs today morning but they might feel that they are a little short. Their bowling line-up is a good one and they need to step up and pick wickets quickly. It will be an interesting run chase. Will England manage to defend this score or will West Indies chase it down easily? Stay tuned to find out..."

Terrific bowling performance from West Indies though. It all started with Holder getting the wicket of his counterpart, Ben Stokes in the final session of Day 4 and then Gabriel joined the party and was brilliant with the second new ball. Alzarri Joseph, who had a tough first innings, was also up to the mark and together they have restricted England with a lead of 199. Gabriel has finished with a 5-fer and now it is over to their batsman to come up with the goods and take a 1-0 lead in this 3-match Test series. It is not going to be easy against the hosts' bowling line-up but that will be challenge they need to overcome."

A pacy bouncer on the leg side, Archer looks to hook it but ends up gloving it to the keeper. Dowrich takes a simple catch. The West Indies players appeal and the umpire raises his finger. Archer takes the review straightaway. Replay rolls in and Shannon is fine with his delivery stride. Time for the Ultra Edge and it shows a spike as it goes past the glove. Hopeful review from Archer but to no avail. England bowled out for 313. West Indies need 200 to win the game and take the lead in the series."

Alzarri Joseph and Shannon Gabriel joined the party and ran riot in the final hour of play. With 5 wickets in the last session, this game has completely turned on its head."

Brilliant bowling from Gabriel. Good length ball on off and straightens after pitching. Bess looks to defend but fails and the ball goes onto hit the top of off stump. Gabriel and West Indies are in the middle of a good spell here and will hope to bowl England out early. The hosts lead by 164 runs."

Holder and his teammates go up in an appeal and the umpire raises his finger. Buttler has a quick word with his partner and signals the 'T' very quickly.

Stokes dismissed in the 40s once more but he has taken England to a strong position. Holder bowls a good length delivery around middle, Stokes moves to the off side and then looks to defend but it takes the outside edge and goes towards Shai Hope who is standing a bit wide at third slip. Big wicket and West Indies have a hope of making it back in this game. 200 wickets for Holder in all formats. Will they be able to restrict the hosts' lead now?"

The hosts were happy to take their time out in the middle. Sibley and Denly were the batsmen to be dismissed in this session. Crawley has looked good so far with the skipper yet to get off the mark. West Indies should not lose hope though and rather than looking at it as 168/3, they should look at it as 54/3. Holder would look to motivate his troops and get them pumped up for the final session of the day. It will also be interesting to find out England's approach. Will they attack or be happy to see off the day with a calm approach? Join us at 1615 Local (1515 GMT) to find out."

Very full delivery around off, Stokes misses and it goes towards slip but the keeper and West Indies think that it has gone off the bat to the slip fielder. The umpire does not think so and shakes his head. Holder at the last moment goes for the review. Brathwaite is fine on his front foot but the Ultra Edge shows that there was a spike but that was of the bat hitting the ground. No spike as the ball passes the bat. Not out is the decision and Stokes survives. Another review wasted by West Indies. England lead by 54 runs."

This is not a delivery he would have envisioned himself getting out to. Nothing delivery from Chase. It is a straighter delivery on the pads, Denly flicks it but does so uppishly, just to the left of Holder at mid-wicket. Denly once again gets the start and throws it away. The West Indies skipper makes no mistake and accepts it graciously. England once again lose a wicket against the run of play. 3 down with the lead of 37."

Holder after some discussion with the umpire, takes the review. Holder is fine on the front foot but was very close to the line. The Ultra Edge rolls in and shows that there is no spike as the ball passed the bat and it has gone off the shoulder. The decision remains not out. Poor review from Holder this time."

Gabriel dishes out a good length ball down the leg side, Sibley cannot resist as he tries to flick this to fine leg but he can only get a faint edge to the keeper who dives to his left to take the catch. Gabriel takes a sigh of relief as that No Ball did not cost much and they have got rid of the set batsman. England trail by 1 run."

It takes the inside edge and goes onto hit the off stump. Sibley is disappointed but he has been told to wait by the umpire. They want to check for the no ball.

The openers, Sibley and Burns, took their time out in the middle and were going along nicely albeit at their own pace. It looked like the pair would see off the first session but against the run of play, Burns fell to a loose delivery off Chase. Denly and Sibley though ensured that there was no further damage. The pitch has looked very flat but towards the end of the session, there was some uneven bounce. West Indies will have to find a way to take wickets as the hosts now trail by just 35 runs. Will England continue to work around and finally get on the front foot in this game or will the tourists make a comeback in the second session? Join us at 1340 Local (1240 GMT) to find out."

West Indies have managed to strike just before Lunch and will be slightly happier going into the break. England trail by 42 runs."

The former ended Day 3 trailing by 99 runs and all their wickets intact. Burns and Sibley looked uncomfortable with a lot of plays and misses but will be happy that they survived and will look to continue batting and get close to taking the lead. A lot will depend on them if they want to make a comeback in this game while they need Denly and others to contribute as well. West Indies, on the other hand, will be the happier side as their bowlers were right on the money. Gabriel and Roach were unlucky not to find any edges though as many deliveries went past the bat. On Day 4, they will hope to take quick wickets and stamp their authority on the game. What will happen? Will England make a comeback or will the visitors run away with the game? Join us in a while."

Can the Three Lions once again do the same or will West Indies keep the upper hand and inch closer to taking a lead in the series? Join us on Saturday, 11th July at 1100 Local (1000 GMT) to catch all the exciting action of this Test match. Till then, take care and goodbye!"

At the beginning of Day 3, it looked like West Indies would run away with the game and gain a big lead. But England came back stronger later in the evening and restricted the visiting team's lead to 114, still quite substantial given the nature of the surface. Burns and Sibley then ensured that they return on Day 4 with all their wickets in the kitty and trail under 100."

Adds that they are looking forward to playing in Manchester. Mentions that this was a hard-fought Test match and admits that they did not have enough runs on the board. Tells that you have to believe that 200 is enough and if you are not, you are already losing. Further states that they got themselves into a strong position but did not make full use of it. Goes on to say that they need to learn to add more runs in the first innings. Shares that they are fortunate to leave someone like Broad and states that Broad is a very passionate cricketer. States that pressure shows itself in different ways and they will take positives and learning from this game. Adds that it will be interesting to see how everyone pulls up for the next Test. Ends by saying that he enjoyed the captaincy but it is Root's team and he will be happy to give the captaincy back to him."

West Indies were good with the bat with Brathwaite, Dowrich and Chase scoring valuable runs to get a lead of 114. Stokes was the pick of the bowlers with a 4-fer while Anderson also contributed decently. In the second essay with the bat, at one stage, England were cruising when Stokes and Crawley were batting but Gabriel's 5-fer pulled things back. With 200 required, Blackwood became a thorn in the English flesh as the visitors overhauled the target quite easily in the end."

Jofra Archer bowled brilliantly throughout this morning but after he gave momentum to the home side, the other bowlers faltered in the afternoon. West Indies scored runs with ease and also got plenty of reprieves. Anderson was good as well but failed to provide the required breakthrough. Stokes bowled exceptionally towards the end but it was a little too late. England need to pull their socks up for the second Test if they want to make a comeback. They have a lot of thinking to do with the make-up of the side. The biggest one being who will go out when Joe Root comes back? Or will Stuart Broad return in the second Test?"

They were terrific with the ball and were good with the bat as well. Talking about this innings, they were down and out chasing 200 as they lost 3 wickets in no time but Blackwood stood tall and along with Chase and Dowrich, helped his side cross the target with ease. Jermaine scored runs at a brisk pace and was stupendous before he was dismissed for 95. The credit has to go to Chase and Dowrich as well for sticking around and not throwing their wickets away."

Stokes bowls a fuller delivery outside off, Jermaine looks to go over mid off. He does not get the desired elevation and ends up hitting it to the right of mid off. Anderson there swiftly moves on that side and takes a simple catch. Blackwood cannot finish it off but what a fantastic knock he has played. Will he be furious to miss out the chance to take his side over the line by himself? Yes absolutely but that does not take away anything from his stupendous knock.  Take a bow!"

Good length ball from Stokes outside off, Dowrich goes for the drive but it takes the outside edge and goes towards first slip where Dom Sibley makes no mistake.

Can England rise from the ashes and win the game from the claws of defeat? Join us at 1615 Local (1515 GMT) for the final session of the game to find out."

West Indies need just 57 runs and it is likely that they will take the lead in this series with some batting still left. Chase fell to a peach of a delivery from Archer but since then, Dowrich and Blackwood have made things easy for the visitors. They go as favourites into Tea as they scored at a quick pace as well, scoring 108 runs in the 30 overs bowled."

What an excellent piece of bowling from Jofra Archer! He has been the best bowler so far in this innings. Jofra bends his back and bowls the effort ball and makes the ball shoot up off the surface. It is a well directed one as well. Chase looks to defend but the awkward height and the pace beats him and the ball kisses his thumb before lobbing off his shoulder to the keeper. Buttler jogs forward and takes a simple catch. Brilliant from Archer. This is why he is so highly rated. Nothing is happening off the surface but he has made it happen. West Indies still on top of this chase but can England make this opening count and make a comeback?"

Archer steams a full delivery pitching around off and it comes in as well. Brooks looks to play it towards mid on but the pace and movement is too good for him. Brooks misses and the ball hits him flush in front. Archer appeals and at the same time starts celebrating as he knows he has his man and the umpire raises his finger. Brooks does not even bother to take it upstairs. Good decision that as the Ball Tracker later on shows that the ball was going to hit the middle stump. This has been an awful start from the West Indies. They are clearly on the back foot here."
