Perfect planning from Bumrah as he rattled Bravo with back-to-back bouncers and then dished a wide fuller ball. The sucker ball one can say. Bravo goes after it but misses to get bat on ball. This was a very risky shot and if you add the fact that this was the last ball of the day, there was no need to go after the ball like that.
