Now, strangely, the men behind the wickets are not sure whether that is out. Shouldn't de Kock know about that? But Faf asks him and Quinton is mum. It is Maharaj who is dead sure that it is pad first. South Africa think for a while and eventually, du Plessis takes the review. Oxenford makes the signal and when his colleague at square leg asks him what was it, Bruce says that it hit the bat. The first look at the replays brings out a huge cheer from the crowd. Because it shows that the ball has hit ONLY the pad and there is no bat involved at all!
