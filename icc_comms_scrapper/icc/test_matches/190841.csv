Elgar is hurried onto the pull and all he can do it lob it back to Stokes who takes an easy catch.

Full ball on middle and leg, Nortje plays this one down to mid on and sets off for a run. Hendricks does not have eyes for his partner and is ball-watching. Nortje has reached the non-striker end and Hendricks is at the same end as well. Hendricks runs towards the striker's end but Sibley at mid on collects the ball and has the presence of mind to throw the ball at the striker's end. Buttler collects the ball and whips the bails off with Hendricks well short.

Not the best of the balls but England and Root will take it. Wood bowls one down the leg side. Nortje looks to go for a fine tickle but fails to do so as it goes to Buttler. The England players immediately go up in appeal but the umpire is unmoved. Root immediately signals the 'T' and the replays roll in. Ultra Edge shows that there was a spike as the ball went past Nortje's glove. The umpire reverses his decision and that will be all. ENGLAND SEAL THE SERIES 3-1!,True,63641,,
