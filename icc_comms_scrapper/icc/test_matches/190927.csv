Floated delivery outside off, Jadeja was aiming for the rough. Muthusamy gets his front foot out and looks to pad it away. Jadeja and the Indian players put in a stifled appeal. The ball goes behind and it looks like the umpire has turned it down but then the umpire raises his finger. Muthusamy has a word with Faf du Plessis and then refers it upstairs. Replay rolls in and shows the impact was outside but as Senuran was not offering any shot that is not an issue. The Ball Tracker then shows the ball was going onto hit the stumps. Muthusamy has to walk back to the pavilion for the first time as this is his first dismissal in the series. Replays later on show Jadeja was not even appealing. He had his hand on his head and was surprised and delighted when the umpire had raised his finger. South Africa lose one of their two reviews.",True,63717,,
