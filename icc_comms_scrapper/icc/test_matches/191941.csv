Roston Chase's brilliant innings comes to an end. Another very good ball from Woakes and he has his second of the innings. Full and quick around off, Chase looks to defend but misses due to the pace and the movement. He gets hit on the pads but there is some noise. England players appeal but the umpire turns it down. Root has a word with Woakes and decides to take it upstairs. Replay rolls in and Ultra Edge shows that the bat hit the pad and not the ball. Time for the Ball Tracker and it shows three reds. Chase has to walk back and England now have two tailenders at the crease.",,,True,58071
