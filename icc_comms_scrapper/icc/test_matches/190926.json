The pick of the bowlers would be Keshav Maharaj and Vernon Philander. However, seeing the ball turn so much late in the evening, the South African batters would be a bit concerned. Join us in a while for the first innings of South Africa as the Indians look to take some early wickets."

The two formed a massive opening stand of 317 runs before Rohit Sharma departed for a superbly made 176. Mayank Agarwal continued the good work after his partner departed as he stitched two 50-plus stands with Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane respectively. Mayank Agarwal stayed at the crease for the longest time as he played a mind-boggling innings of 215 runs. He departed in an attempt to increase the run rate towards the end of the day but not before making a mark on the match. Jadeja and Saha provided the finishing touches as the Indian total crossed the 500-run mark."

He comes down the track and tries to loft this one over the man at cover but he fails to do so and hands a simple catch to Temba Bavuma. Another 50-run stand is broken. Rahane's ordinary form at home continues."

Muthusamy bowls this one short and on middle and off, Kohli looks to tuck this one towards the leg side but is early into the shot due to the ball sticking onto the surface. It takes the leading edge of Kohli's bat and goes straight back towards Muthusamy who takes a dolly. He gets the wicket of the Indian skipper and the budding partnership has been broken."

Rohit Sharma and Mayank Agarwal accelerated towards the latter part of the session. There were a couple of chances here and there for the South Africans but nothing of note except for the dropped catch of Rohit Sharma. However, he departed after playing a beautiful knock of 176 runs and it is now Pujara and Agarwal at the crease. Agarwal also will be looking to build on after scoring his maiden Test ton. What will be the story of the Test match after the Lunch break on Day 2? Stay tuned to find out and join us at 1210 local (0640 GMT) for an extended second session of play."

He loses his balance and his foot is dragged out of the crease as Quinton de Kock dislodges the bails from behind. The square leg umpire raises his finger and Sharma has to walk back. The South African players go up and congratulate him on his great innings as he is dismissed on 176. The massive 317-run partnership comes to an end.

Rohit Sharma silenced his critics with a wonderful unbeaten century and would be looking to add more to his tally today. His partner, Mayank Agarwal is close to reaching his first Test ton and would be hoping to accomplish the milestone early in the first session. The Proteas had a horrid time yesterday with none of their bowlers having a good day. They would be hoping for a better performance as this match is slowly getting out of hand. It is a new day and both teams will have to start fresh. There is rain predicted today as well but let us hope that it stays away and we have an exciting day of Test cricket ahead of us.

He has a chance to make it big here. He brings out the sweep shot but due to the extra bounce, it catches the top edge. Goes uppishly but wide of Rabada at backward square leg who puts in a dive. The ball then races to the fence."

South Africa need a couple of wickets quickly. The good thing for them though is they haven't let India score freely. Will fortunes change for them after the break? We'll find out."

On the wickets to be used in India as a suggestion, Elgar smiles and says that definitely not those which were used in 2015! But on a serious note, Dean says that one needs to graft and get used to the pitch and then play his shots. Credits county cricket for enabling him to become a better player. On him hitting the ball in the air and attacking the spinners, Elgar says that these are one of the best batting conditions in Vizag and also that if you attack the spinners, they tend to lose their line. On Quinton de Kock, he calls him a genius with the bat and is certainly not surprised to see him score a century."

They gave away runs freely and could not get a grip on the game. The experienced trio of South Africa was the first real test for them in the game and they were comfortably outplayed by them as they pulled the visitors from a crisis to a more than comfortable position. However, if one bowler is there who does deserve credit is Ravichandran Ashwin who persisted for long spells and got his rewards from time to time as he took a 5-fer and troubled the tail-enders late in the day."

However, after the early wicket of Temba Bavuma, the real resistance for them began. Dean Elgar and Faf du Plessis counter-attacked the Indian spin bowling and especially India's ace spin bowler, Ravichandran Ashwin. They stitched a huge partnership of 115  and showed the hosts that they are here to fight and not bow down. Following the departure of the Protean skipper on 55, Quinton de Kock came in and attacked the Indian bowlers as well not letting them settle as he scored 111. The star for the visitors although has to be Dean Elgar who played out an innings of grit as well as style to battle his way through the tough spell on Day 2 and early on Day 3. He made 160 runs and has shown the visitors how to battle against this world class Indian bowling attack."

This was a floated ball outside off in the rough, Elgar goes for the slog sweep over the mid-wicket fence. He gets just a top edge on it and the ball skies high up in the air. Pujara from mid-wicket runs in hard and dives forward to complete a brilliant catch. Dean Elgar is dismissed after a fantastic knock and India will now look to open up the lower batting order of the visitors. Jadeja is also the second fastest Indian to  reach the 200-wicket landmark.

Floated one outside off, de Kock looks to defend this one but the ball sneaks from beneath his bat taking the bottom edge. It goes to Saha who cannot react in time to take the catch and it falls just short of Rahane who tries to dive and take it with his right hand. How dearly will India regret this, only time will tell!"

The Indian players appeal and the umpire has no hesitation in giving raising his finger. Bavuma thinks of taking the review but decides against it after having a long chat with his partner, Dean Elgar. Good decision in the end as it looked plumb and the Ball Tracker confirms it as the ball is hitting the middle and leg pole. South Africa lose their first wicket on Day 3."

They had no answer to the bowling of Jadeja and Ashwin. They would be hoping to bat for as long as possible in order to have any chance to get closer to India's score.

Tells that the key to success in a partnership is to stay patient as at times when you are in good touch, you get carried away with your shot selection. He is all praise for Rohit Sharma for the way he handles the spinners. Tells that early on Day 1, there was something in the pitch for the bowlers but later on it settled down into a good batting surface. Informs that post the Lunch break on Day 2, the pitch started to assist the spinners and we also witnessed some uneven bounce. Feels that had Ashwin and Jadeja bowled on Day 1, they would have kept pressure and bowled great lines.

Faf du Plessis eventually does go for the review and the umpire takes it upstairs. Ultra Edge comes in and shows that no bat is involved. Ball Tracker comes in now and shows that the impact is umpire's call. Pujara stays intact and South Africa do not lose their review as well. An eventful last ball and that will be TEA ON DAY 4!"

South African players appeal loudly for a caught behind but the umpire is unmoved. The visiting players mull over taking the review but opt against it. Ultra Edge later confirms that the ball had come off the back thigh pad. Good decision not to review this one."

Floated on middle and off, Sharma comes down the track and heaves it towards long on. Senuran Muthusamy who is standing there catches the ball. However, he loses his balance while taking the catch and throws it up in the air. He crosses the boundary line and comes back in to complete the catch. He is quite confident that he has taken the catch cleanly but the umpires want to get it checked. They go to the third umpire upstairs and the replays roll in. It shows that the toe end of Muthusamy's boot is touching the boundary cushion while he has the ball in his hand. An element of T20 cricket in this but unfortunately for the debutant, it does not bear fruit."

They fought hard for the first 3 days but Day 4 was probably where the game slipped away. There are some technical shortcomings as well, along with the weather conditions. But they need to find answers to all these pretty quickly, as the second Test is upon all from Thursday, 10th October, 2019 from 9.30 am local (0400 GMT) in Pune. Would winning the toss make things any better? Doubt that, with India playing so well but Faf du Plessis can perhaps consult Australian Women's captain, Meg Lanning to help win the toss. ADIOS!

Thanks the coach and management for giving him that chance. Believes that getting 40 points is more important than all that and is happy that India continue to stay at the top of the table in the World Test Championship. On him now opening in all formats, Rohit says that it was communicated to him around 2 years ago, that he might be asked to open, so it was not altogether a surprise and he used to practice really hard in the nets. On him playing watchfully at the start in both white-ball and red-ball cricket, Sharma says that one needs to assess the conditions first and then play your own game. Stresses that the batsman should be leaving the ball outside off, play as close to the ball as possible and then play one's shots, which has been his mantra so far. On being asked about him creating the record for hitting the most number of sixes in a Test, Rohit instantly says that there are quite a few things in Test cricket that he is not aware of. Adds that his main aim was to maintain his focus and outwit the bowlers, who, he believes are very smart these days."

Details that once you get 500 on the board, you are always in the ascending seat irrespective of the fight shown by the opposition. Praises his batsmen in both innings for scoring quickly and says that it was a tough grind, but due to the weather. On the pacers doing well on a track suited to the spinners, Kohli says that it all depends on the attitude. Adds that in the last 2 years, every Indian pacer has looked to contribute on every pitch, albeit bowling shorter spells and communicating well with the captain, even when conditions are difficult. Praises Ashwin and Jadeja for bowling consistently well, on a flat track in the first innings, with the offie taking 7 there and Jadeja taking quick wickets in the second. On Shami's spell this morning, Kohli feels that the pacer has always done well in the recent past and when the ball reverses, he is unstoppable. In the end, praises all the bowlers. On the current quality of the SG ball, Kohli feels that this particular lot is better than the previous one, staying hard for around 40-45 overs but wants it to be harder till at least 60 overs because, even if the pitch is helping you, you would want the ball to do something as well."

After his wicket, the procession of wickets started with Jadeja and Shami being the pick of the bowlers. He started the collapse with three wickets in one over and South Africa were left hanging. India's problem of not being able to finish off the tail resurfaced and the last two wickets have stitched a good partnership to frustrate the bowlers a little bit."

It hits him on the back thigh pad and the Indian players appeal again. This time the umpire agrees with them and raises his finger. This time Maharaj straightaway goes for the review. Ultra Edge shows no bat. Ball Tracker comes in and shows that it is clipping the off pole and thus umpire's call. South Africa retain the review but lose their 8th wicket.

Jadeja tells his captain to straightaway go for the review and Kohli obliges. Replays roll in, nothing on Ultra Edge. Ball Tracker comes into play, pitching in line and THREE REDS. Philander walks back now as India need just 3 more wickets to win."

Day 4 saw India going way ahead in the game setting a target of 395 runs for the Proteas. Although one might question Kohli's decision to delay the declaration, the hosts will feel that they still have enough time in hand to bowl out the visitors. The spin duo of Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin hold the key for the Indians to get a win in this game. The Proteas, on the other hand, again will need to bat out of their skins in order to even secure a draw. They have already lost the wicket of Dean Elgar which is a big blow but would hope for the rest of the batsmen to do the job. They would take heart from the fact that they have never lost a game in India after scoring 400-plus runs  in an innings. There is a hint of rain predicted throughout the day which the South Africans won't mind one bit but it is sunny at the moment. An enthralling final day awaits us. Stay with us for all the action from Visakhapatnam."
