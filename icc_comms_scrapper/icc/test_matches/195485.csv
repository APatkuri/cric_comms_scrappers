Just when you thought Australia were running away with the game, India comes back and grab two quick wickets. This is a shortish length delivery around off, Labuschagne looks to pull but once again is done in by the extra bounce. The ball takes the top edge and lobs near the short fine leg area. Pant calls for it, keeps his eyes on the ball and takes a good catch. So the extra bounce seems to be troubling the Aussie batters. Two well-set batters getting out in a similar manner. Two new batters out there now on a wicket which is not that easy to begin on. Can India make full use of it? Can they take another quickly?
