They failed to cross the 200-run mark after being 127 for 3. Just the three batters scoring in double digits out of the 11 is always a sorry scorecard."

Babar looked very strong and got to his fifty but drinks brought in a lapse of concentration for him as soon after he was stumped. The Sri Lankan spinners then started to take charge. They put brakes on the run flow. Haris struggled and just before the end of the session his struggles came to an end. Asad Shafiq is still there unbeaten on 49 and the onus will be on him to bat with the lower order. Lasith Embuldeniya was the star of the session getting both the scalp for the tourists. One would feel it was an even session but Sri Lanka will be the happier of the two sides. What is in store in the final session of the day? Join us after the break to find out."

Brilliant bowling this from Lasith. Gives this air on off, the ball turns and bounces away from Babar. Azam tries to come down the track and defend it but gets beaten. Dickwella behind the stumps does the rest as Babar was too far down the track. Maybe the break brought in a lapse of concentration here for the ever focused Babar."

Abid Ali and Babar Azam then continued from where they left off at Rawalpindi but after getting off to a start Abid failed to convert it this time as Lahiru Kumara got rid of him just about 12 minutes before the break. Asad Shafiq has joined Babar Azam who has looked good so far for his 27. Can the duo take the charge in the second session and put the hosts on the front foot or will Sri Lanka continue to impress?"

Very good ball this from Kumara. Fast and swinging in from around off. Abid looks to defend but misses and the ball hits him on the front pad. There is a huge appeal and the umpire raises his finger. Abid has a word with Babar, they discuss for a while and then in the dying seconds he signals the 'T'. Replay rolls in and Ultra Edge first shows no involvement of bat. Ball Tracker then comes up next and it shows all red as the ball was hitting the middle stump. Crucial wicket for the visitors, Abid was looking very good out in the middle and one would feel this wicket has come against the run of play."

Waqar says that they are bringing back Yasir Shah and he is hopeful that he can do a good job as he has done in the past.

On the bowling end of things, the hosts will be forced to make a change as Usman Shinwari is ill so it will be interesting to see if the hosts replace him with leg spinner Yasir Shah or once again surprise everyone and go without a proper spinner. Coming to the visitors, in the one inning they batted they would be disappointed with their collapse and Dimuth Karunaratne will hope that his troops can correct it. Their bowling was lacklustre and looked void of ideas and they will need to find a way to improve that. It will be interesting to see how many changes the tourists make for this one. With the series and 60 points in the ICC World Test Championship up for grabs who will come out on top in this tasty encounter?"

Afridi bowls a pacy ball around middle and leg, Dilruwan looks to flick but he is early into the shot. It hits him flush on the pads and Afridi makes a loud appeal. The umpire raises the finger instantly. Perera too signals the 'T' without taking any time. Can the DRS save him? Let's find out. Front foot is okay. No willow, confirms the Ultra Edge. Here comes the Ball Tracker. Pitching in line. Hitting the wickets? No, but it is clipping the wickets, which means umpire's call stays and Perera has to depart for 48. A top innings though from him to help Pakistan take a good lead."

After the loss of Chandimal, Dilruwan has kept majority of the strikes and is looking to score quick runs. Abbas and Haris Sohail were the one to get into the wickets column.

It is a shortish length just outside off, Perera looks to defend it off the back foot but misses to get hit on the pads. The bowler and the slip cordon appeals but not out says the umpire. Shaheen though is sure as he asks the skipper to go for the DRS. And he then eventually himself signals it to the umpire. Let's see what the replays show. The front foot is okay. Time for Ultra Edge, nothing on it. Ball Tracker time. Here it comes, It is just clipping the bails of off and middle. Umpire's call it will be then, on hitting the stumps. So, Perera stays. Pakistan keep their review."

Dickwella looks to defend it with a straight bat but the ball zips in and hits the top of off. Every pacer likes to hit the top of the stumps and he has hit just that. Too good!

The centurion from the last game though could not convert his start but Chandimal looks set and he is joined by Dickwella.

Gem of a delivery this. Good length ball pitching on off. It jags back in viciously. Dinesh looks to defend but the ball goes right through the gate of pad and bat. It clips something on its way to the keeper. Shaheen is convinced that kiss came of the bat but Rizwan does not go up and the umpire agrees with Rizwan. They think about the review but opt against it. Good decision as replays later on confirm that the ball kissed the thigh pad. Very good decision from Bruce Oxenford."

It's the man in form, the man who had a century in the previous game and the man who was looking very good out in the middle, Dhananjaya de Silva. Shaheen strikes again in his spell. It is the short ball that has done the trick for the hosts. A very well directed bouncer from Shaheen, it is on the body and catches Dhananjaya de Silva by surprise. He is hurried into the pull and ends up top edging it to the right of fine leg. Abbas comes running in and takes a very good catch. Shaheen brings out his trademark celebration. One has to credit Mohammad Rizwan as well as before this delivery was bowled it was he who suggested Shaheen to bang it in short. So excellent work from the keeper as well. As they say that bowler and keeper's have a special partnership. The 67-run stand is broken and Sri Lanka still trail by 44 runs."

The visitors are slightly on the front foot but will need to bat really well and try and get some significant lead in this bowler friendly wicket. They'd hope to avoid a collapse unlike their counterparts and get a further grip on this game. Pakistan, on the other hand, are well and truly in this game. They know a few early blows in the day will put the tourists under pressure and they would look to do just that. The pitch has turn and bounce on offer and we are yet to see Yasir Shah and anyone who has followed Pakistan's Test side in the recent past knows how lethal he can be. So the ball dominated the bat on Day 1 will the story continue or will it will be the chance of the willow to shine? What's in store? Stay tuned to find out."

The ball goes past the outside edge and straight into the gloves of Rizwan. He is up and cheering. The fielders from slip cordon are also sure that they have their man. They look at the umpire but he is unmoved. They take it upstairs. Ultra Edge rolls in and it shows a spike as the ball goes past the bat."

Sri Lanka's misery was far from ending as Babar Azam joined the skipper and added unbeaten 40 runs between them. Azhar is unbeaten on 57 while Babar has looked solid for his 22."

Everyone in the stadium is up on its feet as he walks off. Similar way he got out in the previous innings. Fast and pacy delivery pitching around off. It jags back in, Abid looks to defend but gets beaten by the pace of it and the ball hits him on the pads. Sri Lankan players go up in a huge appeal and the umpire slowly raises his finger. Abid knows he is a goner but after talking to his partner, he signals the 'T' in the eleventh hour. Replay rolls in and Ultra Edge shows there is no involvement of the bat. Ball Tracker then comes in and it shows all red as  the ball was going onto crash the middle stump. To the dismay of everyone, Abid will have to walk back but what a fine player he is. He will be disappointed not to get to his double century. But it has been a great knock and he has put his side in a great position in this game. He walks back looking as fresh as he came out to bat in  the first day of this Test. Though he is 32, he looks like a fine player and one feels he will be a big player for this side for a few years to come."

He is late in his pull and he ends up hitting it in  the air straight to the man at deep mid-wicket. Oshada Fernando there comes running in and takes a good catch. The 278-run partnership is broken.

He had starts during the Australia tour but he could not convert there but he has done it here. He has been around for a while in red-ball cricket. He has taken quite some time to get to the three figure mark in Tests. Shortish length ball around off, Masood taps it towards backward point and takes a quick single. He takes off the helmet and soaks all the applauds. Brilliant, brilliant innings this one."

The opening pair of Abid Ali and Shan Masood have been very good, especially Abid Ali who is just 7 away from his second Test ton in his second Test. The duo have added 175 with Shan on 78. The hosts lead by 95 runs and are on the driver's seat. They will be very pleased with their efforts. As for Sri Lanka they have a lot of work to do. They have been toyed with in the first session and they need to regather and revisit their plans and try and come stronger in the second session. Will Pakistan continue their dominance or will Sri Lanka somehow find a source of inspiration? Join us after the break to find out."

It looked very close to the naked eye. A similar delivery which got rid of Abid in the first innings. Pacy inswinging ball pitching around off and coming back in. Abid looks to defend but misses and the ball hits him on the pads over the knee roll. The Sri Lankan players put in a huge, confident appeal but the umpire turns it down. Karunaratne signals the 'T'. Replay rolls in and Ultra Edge confirms no spike. Time for the decisive Ball Tracker and it shows that the ball was going over the stumps."

After having a deficit of 80, the Pakistan openers have done really well to reduce it to just 23 and still have all the 10 wickets in hand. The duo of Abid Ali and Shan Masood will look to continue that this morning as well and their first aim would be to get these 23 runs without losing a wicket. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, will look to improve with the ball. They were very poor with it last evening and need to refocus and revisit their plans. The pitch has started to break just a hint but still it has become a good pitch to bat on. A very important day awaits us in a match where everything is right under the balance.  Will the host score plenty of runs and take the ascendancy in this game or will the visitors once again take the driver's seat? Stay tuned to find out."

Join us on Saturday, 21st December to find out. The play will begin at 1000 local (0500 GMT). Till then, it's goodbye from us!"

Thanks the Sri Lankans from the bottom of his heart for travelling to Pakistan and further says that the Lankans have no idea about the happiness given by them to Pakistan cricket fans by this gesture. Coming over to this series, Azhar says that it has been a tough passage of time in the recent past but they wanted to start their home season well. Feels satisfied with this result. On exciting talents in Shaheen Afridi and Naseem Shah, Ali is awed by their skill, especially their ability to learn the art of fast bowling very quickly. Praises all the fast bowlers for coming hard in the first innings after the batsmen got bowled out for 191. Then, he comes to the openers in the second innings, for setting the tone and taking the game away from Sri Lanka. But also finds words of praise for Babar Azam and Asad Shafiq for fighting hard in the first innings. On Pakistan bouncing back in the second innings, Azhar says that is the job of the team management - keep the team calm under pressure - which was done and the effect showed. On his own return to form, Ali is happy to have finally got a big innings after a long time and hopes to carry on this form. On the summary of the two Tests, Azhar wants to take this confidence into away series. Praises the bowlers because no one had an idea how to bowl on Pakistan wickets but adjusting well and quickly. Hopes to build on this confidence now. Thanks the security agencies for their excellent work and also the crowd for turning up in large numbers."

Perhaps at that stage, the Lankans took it lightly. They expected the pitch to offer sideways and lateral movement, including spin but were not consistent at all. Pakistan, on the other hand, knew they had their backs to the wall and had no way to go but ahead. And they went. On and on and on they went. For 131 overs, with the top 4 scoring centuries. Then in the final innings, when Sri Lanka were pushed into a corner, the visitors cowed away."

Rizwan straightaway starts to celebrate and so does Naseem but then they realize that Embuldeniya is not going anywhere as he has not been given out. Now, Naseem appeals. But umpire Joel Wilson shakes his head. Azhar Ali comes down towards his bowler, discusses with his mates and then signals the 'T'.

Naseem reads all of these. He smartly bowls a length ball, which is slightly wide outside off. What is so smart about that, do you ask? Mind games. Perera is in two minds whether to play or leave and since this is on a length, thinks he can play. Pushes at the wide one and edges it behind. Naseem is jubilant. What a setup to the tail-ender.

Just 27 balls left in the day, or 13 minutes left in the day's play and an entertaining 104-run stand has been broken. Really looks like Dickwella has got carried away. Rizwan was chirping behind the stumps for the last 30 minutes, saying 'ANNA HARI! ANNA HARI!' and even chuckling as Dickwella was responding to that. But sadly for the Lankan, the banter has resulted in his dismissal."

A length ball around off, sheer pace, Chandimal comes half forward to defend but misses and is hit on the pads, totally beaten by pace. Naseem appeals vociferously but umpire Wilson shakes his head and indicates inside edge. The appeal dies down but Azhar Ali charges in from mid off and asks his keeper just one thing. 'PITCHED IN LINE? PITCHED IN LINE?' Yes, says Rizwan. Immediately the signal comes up for the 'T'. Ultra Edge shows that there is no inside edge and the two sounds came because of the ball hitting both pads. Ball Tracker comes into play and shows the ball to be crashing into the stumps. Second wicket for Naseem."

Pitched outside off, just straightening a touch, Karunaratne is stuck in the crease as he plays a loose waft. Does so well away from his body and gets a thick outside edge. The edge threatens to go between the keeper and first slip but Mohammad Rizwan dives to his left and takes a stunner. In the last 5-10 minutes, it did seem like a wicket was around the corner. And Karunaratne has struck for Pakistan. Yes. Karunaratne. He alone is responsible for his dismissal."
