Another peach of a delivery. He bowls it on a length on off and makes the ball jag back in. Pope looks to flick but this ball is just too good for him. He misses and the ball hits him on his back pad and goes onto the off pole. Terrific start for West Indies, exactly the opposite for the hosts."

Excellent line and length from Gabriel. He bowls it around off, in the channel of uncertainity. Pope looks to defend it but the ball takes the outside edge and goes to the left of first slip. Cornwell there moves to that side, gets his hands on it but fails to hold onto it. He goes down trying to take the rebound but to no avail. Life for Pope but West Indies have started well here."

Roach and Chase were the two bowlers with the wickets with 2 and 1 each with the latter also contributing with a run out. Gabriel bowled his heart out but to no reward. Cornwall and Holder also had a non-fruitful day."

Burns though played well for his 57 but the Windies kept on chipping wickets. They had the upper hand in the first two sessions and had England at 122/4. But the pair who so far had struggled with the bat decided to find form at the right time for its side. The duo of Pope and Buttler steadied the ship and ensured that there was no more damage on Day 1. The pair has added an unbeaten 136-run stand with Pope on 91 and Buttler on 56. This has ensured that it is England who are in the driver's seat at the end of Day 1."

Holder decides to take the review. Replay rolls in and first Ultra Edge confirms there is no bat involved. Time for the Ball Tracker, it shows that the pitching is not an issue and neither is the impact but the ball is doing too much and misses the stumps on Ball Tracker. West Indies lose their review and Pope marches on."

Harsh to call it a drop because he was always up against it and it was a terrific effort from him. Gabriel hits the deck hard and bowls it around the body of Pope. The ball comes in just around his belly. He looks to turn it on the leg side but gets a leading edge which goes high in the air behind mid-wicket. Chase runs behind from short mid-wicket and gives the catch a chase. He dives and gets his fingers to it but cannot hold onto it. Excellent effort from the all-rounder. Lucky escape for Pope. He should have played pull to that ball."

Short and outside off, Burns rocks back to cut but is too close to the ball. He gets a thick outside edge as a result and the ball flies thick and fast to first slip. The giant Rahkeem Cornwall there, has barely any time to react but he trusts his instincts. He just thrusts his right hand and the ball sticks! Tremendous reflexes. Chase is ringing the bells again, as his celebration suggests. Now, about the Strauss comment. Sir Andrew Strauss on air, felt that after including an extra spinner in your side, you should not be bowling first. He was just saying 'Hmmmm...' pondering over something else to say when Chase struck. Poor from Burns. Should have carried on!"

Back-to-back run out for Joe Root. The last one was a sacrfice not this time. Floated delivery on off, Burns looks to defend but the ball goes to the right of short third man. Root calls for a quick single and goes for it. Chase gets to the ball quickly and has a shy at the keeper's end. The ball kisses the bail. Root stretches but does not dive. The West Indies players are up in celebration. The umpire goes to the T.V. umpire help. Replay rolls in and shows that the ball kissed the bail and dislodged them and when that happened the English skipper was short of his crease. Had it not been a direct hit, Root would have survived. Just when Joe Root was getting along his innings has been cut short. Brilliant work from Roston Chase! He has had a terrific series in all three departments. West Indies strike one more before Lunch."

So he feels the impact is outside off and gives it not out. West Indies refer it upstairs and even the third umpire feels that the impact is outside off. Hence, the review is turned down.

England have plenty of selection headaches regarding their bowlers, but it is a good headache to have considering the options that Root has to call upon. West Indies, on the other hand, would need to decide if they want to rest some of their bowlers and give someone else a chance. There have been noise from the outside to include Rahkeem Cornwall in the starting XI and by doing that, bringing in a specialist spinner. In the batting department, they need Shai Hope as well to come back to form. The forecast has not been great for this Test, with rain predicted on all 5 days. Let's hope it stays away. Join us in a while for the toss and further updates."

Cornwall looks to play it across the line as he looks to flick. He misses and gets hit on the pads. Broad goes up in appeal along with his teammates and the umpire agrees. Cornwall decides to take the review. Replay rolls in and Ultra Edge first shows no involvement of bat. Time for the Ball Tracker and it shows three reds. Cornwall has to walk back and England just two wickets away from batting again."

Ultra Edge first rolls in and it shows that there is no bat involved. Time for the all-important Ball Tracker and it shows all reds.

Ollie Pope there dives to his right and takes a very good catch. Holder stays to see whether Woakes has overstepped his line or not. Replay rolls and it finds Chris Woakes guilty. Big let off for Holder as Woakes is very disciplined bowler. Chris makes a mistake and pays for it. How costly will this prove to be?"

The nip-backer, as it is always called when Stewy bowls. On a length, outside off, Chase looks to stay back and defend. But the ball nips back in and stays low a touch as well. This is just Day 2, so cannot really blame Chase for playing back. Hits Chase on the knee roll as he misses his defense and there is an appeal. Not from Broad. He celebrates first, then as if like an obligation, turns back and asks umpire Kettleborough, who already has his finger up. Now now, Stewy, you don't want to be spending the evening in dad's office, do you? As per the rule, a bowler needs to appeal before celebrating, if it involves the decision of the umpire. Remember, the great Glenn McGrath being warned, around 15 years back for not appealing? Coming to this ball, Ball Tracker shows it to be clipping the bails."

Blackwood, without much of a chat with Chase, goes for the review. That is his confidence. And lo! Ball Tracker shows it to be missing leg stump! Excellent bowling from Jimmy. But it did too much!"

Shamarh is caught off guard, as he fails to pick the shine on the ball. Plays for the outswinger but has to adjust late for the inswinger. Too late. Inside edge is taken and Buttler does the rest.

But the ball keeps on rising and all he can do is try and get his gloves out of the way. But he can't.  The ball goes to gully where Rory Burns completes the formalities. West Indies are 44/2, of which, Campbell made 32! This could effect their scoring now."

On being asked by Ebony as to how does he feel on not being able to touch 250, Mikey says that he does not feel anything, as 250 is just a number. He further adds that plenty of people ask him whether he could have played more games to get to 250 but he curtly says ,'No, thank you!' Ebony tries to convince him that it could have perhaps been just one more game but Holding serenely replies - 'If it is a win for West Indies, then 250 is better than 249. Else not.' Ends by saying that numbers need context, else they do not matter. Gives an example that someone might have taken 1000 wickets but in 500 games. What's the use? Hats off to the legend. Are milestone dreamers listening?"

Ben Stokes there moves to his right but the ball goes in and comes out of his hand. He is shattered as we all know he sets a very high benchmark for himself. Anderson cannot believe it that he has not had his first victim today."

Also, he just used to come and bang the ball on the deck, which is a total waste of the new cherry. But of late, this new Broad has started to keep the ball much fuller and hence, he has managed to get some movement."

Holder too injured his thumb which added salt to the wound. The skipper still managed to get a wicket along with Chase. Rahkeem Cornwall bowled the most overs but without any success.

If they bowl with fire and get England all out quickly, that would mean enough time for the hosts to get them out as well, in spite of the poor weather. On the other hand, playing for time, hoping that the rain would come, will not help either! Probably, the best way to play would be just enjoy the game. Give your best and hope for the best. It has been a painful 16 overs for West Indies, with Jason Holder and Shane Dowrich getting injured. There was a stumping chance, of Burns, but da Silva could not quite get it done. The glovework was good, but the footwork let him down."

West Indies showed a lot of promise at the beginning of the tour but with every Test and passing day in those Tests, they looked tired and their fight started to surrender. After being put into bat, the hosts were in a state of bother at 122/4 but a brilliant 140-run stand between Pope and Buttler along with Broad's counter-attacking 62 propelled them to 369. Kemar Roach was the pick of the bowlers for the hosts as he finished the first innings with a 4-fer."

Good length ball pitching on off and middle and nipping back in. Holder looks to play it straight but misses and gets hit on the pads. Woakes and co. go up in appeal and the umpire raises his finger. Holder decides to signal the 'T' straightaway. Only an inside edge could probably save him there. Replay rolls in and Ultra Edge shows no involvement of bat. Ball Tracker then comes and brings bad news for Holder as it shows three reds. The skipper departs and along with him goes the tiny tinker of Caribbean hopes of survival."

Bess at backward point runs to his right, gets to the ball and turns. He has to score a direct hit as Buttler has not reached the stumps and Bess does hit the stumps. Excellent from the spinner. Chase is well short of his crease and the umpire does not even go upstairs. Chase does not look back and continues his walk to the pavillion. Brilliant from Bess, he has not had much to do but he has shown his concentration and has done a job when called upon albeit in the field."

The ball shapes in and kisses the inside edge as it goes low to the left of Buttler. He takes an easy catch behind the stumps. Looks like the only way West Indies can save this Test match is by looking up at the skies but at the moment they are not helping the tourists."

Three players are coming for it but Broad wants to be part of the action so he calls it out loudly. He keeps his eyes on the ball and takes a good catch. Hope's struggle in the longest format continues and there will be a lot of questions asked and he will have to retrospect and think, was that shot really necessary?"

It would be good for majority of the top order batsmen, it was going to be too good for the night watchman. Broad bowls it full around off and the ball shapes away a bit. Roach looks to defend but the ball kisses his outside edge and goes straight into the mitts of Buttler. Can he end the day now with wicket no. 500?"

Skipper, Joe Root there makes no mistake and takes a relatively easy catch. Just the start England would have wanted. Nightmare beginning to the chase for the Caribbean nation."
