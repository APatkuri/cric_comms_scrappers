Cornwall does not last long and a very tough Test match for him comes to an end. Poor footwork from Cornwall. Good length ball on off and angling in. Rahkeem looks to play but with no foot movement and gets trapped in the crease. The ball hits him flush on the pads. Appeal for LBW and the umpire gives Cornwall his marching order. He too does not review and walks to the pavilion.,True,58140,,
