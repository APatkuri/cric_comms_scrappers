Root reacts late to his right and goes with one hand but the ball does not stick. It goes behind for one. Probably Burns is not used to standing at second slip as he was fielding at gully for most of the series. Since Bairstow is keeping in this game, Burns takes that role of fielding in the slips. We saw Jonny Bairstow take a similar catch in the last game where he dived to his left with one hand. Also, Root and Burns are standing way too close, and hence, that confusion.

He never played a game for England but is remembered fondly by many fans of the Ashes and England. Of course, bitterly by Australia as well. The then Aussie captain, Ricky Ponting, had raised the usage of substitutes on the cricketing field and got angered and irritated when Pratt fired a throw from cover to catch Ponting short at the bowler's end, during the 2005 Ashes. Something similar could have happened here. Full, around off, Rory Burns came forward and then went back to play it to the leg side. Now, as is the flow of momentum, Burns went out of the crease and at that very moment, Suryakumar Yadav, the substitute, standing at short leg, stopped the ball to his left. He immediately transferred the ball to his right hand and fired a throw at the striker's end. He missed and every Indian player on the field had his hands over his head. Was Burns caught napping? He does get two overthrows as the ball goes to fine leg. No sir. Replays show that even if Yadav had hit the stumps, Burns would have been home. Surya reacted swiftly but so did Burns as he did not commit the cardinal sin of committing way too much into the run. So he was able to stop and turn back and get his bat back in the crease, before the ball could hit the stumps. Fantastic cricket at the end of the day, giving us more drama!",2021-09-05T17:47:41+00:00,64164,Haseeb Hameed,77/0,2,2,,189,,,,,,,,4,3,,,
