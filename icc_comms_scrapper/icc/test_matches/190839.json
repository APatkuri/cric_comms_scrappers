A short ball again, at the body, Pope comes down the track and looks to swat this out of the park. But he is cramped for room and gets a top edge. The ball swirls in the air towards fine leg where Vernon Philander comes running in, does really well to focus on the ball and takes a very good catch. The players are ready to head off the field but umpire Dharmasena wants to check for the overstepping. And yes, replays confirm that Rabada has overstepped. Now, the umpire wants to check whether the batsmen had crossed when the catch was being taken. Yup, the batsmen had crossed, as per the replays. So Anderson will face the remaining two balls of this over. Interestingly, Mike Atherton on air informs us that two balls before Rabada had overstepped but it was not called!"

He chooses the latter. Takes two and Jimmy is ready for the third, turning blind. But Pope rightly sends him back, as he is not sure whether he will make it in time to the bowler's end. Good decision in the end as the throw was pretty sharp. But why did he not just settle for a single?"

Will the ball come in? What if I lose my stumps like Curran did? Poor Bess cannot be blamed entirely. He sees that pitch around the 4th stump outside off and is caught in two minds as to which way will the ball move. He looks to play this straight, down the ground but to his dismay, the ball pitches and then straightens. Enough to take the outside edge. Simple catch for Quinton de Kock. 3/10 in 32 balls!"

Pretorius maintains his line and length outside off and Jos, by habit, looks to push. But the ball nibbles away off the seam and squares him up. There is a noise as the ball goes past the bat and de Kock and Pretorius go up. The finger from the man who matters the most goes up as well. Joseph does not bother waiting. Ultra Edge shows a thin spike. Another start wasted."

And it is the man who scored a double century the first time he batted here in Tests. Ben Stokes looks at the ground crestfallen. He takes half a minute or so and then trudges off. This is a big boost for the Proteas. Full and outside off, Stokes looks to drive but his bottom hand comes off the bat. As a result, he is not in control of the shot and the ball flies off the face of the bat, straight to Dean Elgar at short cover. This did not hit a divot. This did not deviate off the seam. This did not swing in the air. Like many unexplained things in the universe, this just happened. Perhaps, when you are facing a bloke bowling close to 90 miles an hour, you sometimes do not have control of your shots. This was one of those times. This is what pace brings to Test cricket."

Maharaj floats this one up on middle and leg, Pope looks to defend it but gets hit flush on the pads. Maharaj appeals but the umpire shakes his head. Maharaj is confident and convinces Faf to go for the review. The Ultra Edge rolls in and it shows that there was no bat on it. The Ball Tracker is up now and it is umpire's call on hitting the leg stump. The Proteas do not lose a review."

In the final session, the Protea bowlers will look to take a few quick wickets and put the visitors under the pump. How  will things pan out in the final session? We will soon find out. Join us for the final session of the day after the break."

England, unlike the first session, started on a better note but lost skipper Root, courtesy a vicious bumper from Nortje. Denly dug in well but became a victim of Maharaj as he left a gap between his bat and pad. Both Root and Denly will rue the fact that they did really well to grind it out but could not go onto score a big one. Stokes has looked solid so far and would look to build a stand with Pope post the break."

Very rarely do we see him so indecisive about shot-making. This was one of those moments. A length ball outside off, Ben is in two minds, whether to play at that or let it go. In the end, he does try that run-down-to-third-man shot but is late and gets a thick outside edge. Luckily for him, it goes between second slip and gully and the ball races to the third man fence. Nasser Hussain on air calls it a 'One-Day shot'. We have seen Joe Root play that shot so often in every format and even today, he was cross with himself for getting out. The reason - you can leave balls pitched outside off. Rabada will be frustrated a touch that did not go to hand but he will also be happy that he is causing some doubts in Stokesy's mind."

Anrich Nortje was charging in to bowl but he was stopped by Ben Stokes as he saw the bird casually pecking the grass at mid on, looking for food. Nortje goes back, tries to shoo the bird away but in a more of 'mind-your-own-business' style, it continues to go about its stuff and ignores Nortje. Eventually, Stokes, after realizing that he can watch the details better in a Discovery Channel better, decides to get on with it. We were actually struggling to find the name of that bird. So after a bit of a research, got the name. 'The hadeda ibis (Bostrychia hagedash), also called hadada, is an ibis native to Sub-Saharan Africa. It is named for its loud three to four note calls uttered in flight especially in the mornings and evenings when they fly out or return to their roost trees. Although not as dependent on water as some ibises, they are found near wetlands and often live in close proximity to humans, foraging in cultivated land and gardens. Bless you, researchers..."

Brilliant from Nortje. 148 kph bumper on middle, Root looks to duck under it but he is quite late in doing so. He ends up lobbing the ball towards de Kock. De Koock pouches it easily. The bowler appeals but de Kock is not very sure. The umpire signals nothing but Root walks off. Rassie and de Kock will be the relieved men. South Africa break another good-looking stand to dent the English progress. The replays roll in and show that the ball hit the gloves of Root."

After opting to bat first, England lost Crawley early but Sibley and Denly saw off the initial threat from Philander and Rabada after that. Once they got themselves settled, the duo batted well. It looked like both of them will see off the session but Sibley found himself poking at the ball he should've left alone and ended up losing his wicket. Denly and Root saw off the tricky phase to finish the session on 67/2."

England, on the other hand, are still dealing with viral to multiple players. To their misery, one of their in-form batter, Rory Burns has been ruled out of the series as he got injured while playing football. Now, who will replace him? Or who will partner Sibley at the top? England will have a task cut out in deciding their playing XI. How will things pan out? It's gonna be an interesting game for sure. Will we get to see the Protea juggernaut moving ahead or will the Three Lions bounce back to get level in the 4-match series. Hello and a warm welcome to the 2nd Test.

They were 40 for 3 at one stage and then a comeback of sorts happened. A 117-run stand between Elgar And van der Dussen made everyone think that they were in control. However, once Elgar and Quinton de Kock threw away their wickets, the Proteas never recovered and conceded a valuable lead of 46 runs. The South African bowlers have a tough task ahead as they need to pick up wickets at regular intervals in order to get back in this game. Can they make a comeback or will the visitors run away with the match? Join us in a while to find out."

They have put in an incredible effort in the field as they go back to the pavilion with a lead of 46 runs. Anderson and Broad were terrific from the start. They reduced the hosts to 40/3 but then Rassie van der Dussen and Dean Elgar combined to form a terrific stand of 117 runs. In that period, 12 No Balls were not picked by the on-field umpire. However, when van der Dussen was dismissed but the on-field umpire then referred upstairs to check for a No Ball and Rassie survived. Stokes dropped a catch too. It looked like South Africa would make them pay. But once Elgar fell, it was a procession as they lost their last six wickets for just 32 runs. James Anderson picked up a 5-fer, his 28th in Test cricket, surpassing the record for an English player set by legend, Sir Ian Botham. However, it was Stuart Broad who was the pick of the bowlers as he kept on bowling perfect lines and lengths throughout Day 2."

This is a terrific ball from James Anderson. A good length ball outside off, inducing the drive from Anrich Nortje. The batter obliges but he manages just an outside edge on it. The ball flies to the right of first slip and to the left of second slip. Stokes from second slip dives to his left and takes a superb catch to end the South African innings. Stokes takes his 5th catch of this innings and becomes the first outfield English player to do so. All smiles for the England players as they return to the pavilion."

They still trail by 54 runs and Philander would be hoping that the two remaining batters support him out in the middle and get the team as close to England's score. The visitors, on the other hand, would want to get the two remaining wickets as soon as possible and then swell their lead to give the home team a tough target. However, on Day 2 itself we could see some dust coming off the surface and that would be exciting for Keshav Maharaj. Both sides' batting has been average and when England come to bat, it will surely not be easy on this wicket. Stay tuned for all the action as a crucial day for both these sides lie ahead!"

He is not sure whether to come forward or not but his basic foot movement is to plant his left foot forward, almost like a reflex action. Now, this is a good length ball outside off and van der Dussen has his left foot planted across. When you do that, it is very difficult to leave balls. The cherry is a touch wide but RvdD has already made up his mind to run this down to third man. Then, when he sees the line, he thinks he can leave it alone. But alas, it is too late. The ball lands and then bounces a touch high. Van der Dussen is in no man's land, just hanging his bat with its face open. The ball takes the outside edge and flies behind. Ben Stokes at slip number 2 dives to his right and takes an excellent catch with both hands. Rassie has to go after playing an excellent knock. South Africa needed him to stay till the end tonight. The deficit is reading 69 and there are still 9 overs left in the day."

Just like yesterday, the last session is seeing wickets. Curran's change in pace has done in de Kock here. He rolls his fingers on the ball and lands it on a length outside off. Quinton is early into his shot as he looks to heave and gets a leading edge. It goes high up in the air towards mid off. James Anderson moves to his left from mid off and takes a simple catch. QdK is dejected and looks at the ground before walking off. Has this game opened up again? The deficit is 78. We might be in for a shout regarding a one-inning shootout."

Very rarely do we see him doing this but he has thrown it away after playing an excellent innings. He and van der Dussen were running away with the game and this might just bring the visitors back in it. Bess floats this one up outside off, Elgar strides forward and looks to lift it over mid off. However, the ball is not that full to be hit on the rise. He is already through his shot and there is extra bounce on that one. Hence, he does not time it well and it goes high up in the air. Root moves back from mid off and takes the catch. Not easy to catch those. A 100 was there for the taking for Elgar but it was not to be. Elgar is disappointed and looks up to the skies as trudges back to the pavillion. So what is the deficit? 112. Can England get another before it trickles into double digits? Sorry, cannot say trickles. Because the man coming in next will not allow the run rate to trickle down."

The batsman could do nothing and just managed a glove back to the keeper. Buttler pouched it safely. The umpire gave it out and Rassie started walking. But wait, he was told to stay back as the on-field umpires wanted to check for the no ball. The replas rolled in and it showed that Broad had overstepped by a big margin!

Elgar has looked good and with van der Dussen, he will look to consolidate and stitch a big partnership. England though would look to bowl them out and get a big lead. What will happen?

While this is a Test match and it is not going to be easy. But remember, nothing is impossible in cricket. However, honestly, one would feel that they will try to play session by session and then plan accordingly. England, on the other hand, would be keen to bundle the Proteas and level the series. The final innings of the Test will start in a while."

And rather than wait for England to declare they should try and bowl them out quickly and carry some momentum before they walk out to bat. What will happen? Join us after the break for the second session to find out."

They have managed to take 3 wickets but that has come because England were throwing everything at it. Keshav Maharaj has bowled from one end throughout the session and he has been taken to the cleaners. He has struggled massively and one feels he has been thrown under the bus. There was a little bit of respite for him as he took the wicket of the dangerous Ben Stokes. Rabada and Nortje, who has been unwell picked the other two wickets to have fallen in this session. But it has been a poor performance by the Proteas in the first session."

The day started with Ben Stokes going hammer and tonks. The pair of Sibley and Stokes added 92 off just 103 with the all-rounder scoring 72 off just 47 balls. Sibley continued his overnight's good work and is still unbeaten there on 125. Buttler then replaced Ben and he continued from where his teammate left off. Jos though could not continue his firecrackers for long. They have scored a mammoth 157 runs in this session at an ODI run rate of 5.81."

He ends up getting an inside edge and the ball goes onto uproot the leg pole. England lead by 360. South Africa will now look to wrap it up under 400!"

He was putting on a show out there and was on his way to a quickfire century but it has been cut short. Maharaj who has had a torrid time with the ball finally has something to cheer about. Floated delivery around off, Stokes once again goes for the big slog sweep. He does not connect it well and the bat also turns in his hand. It goes to the right of long on. Rassie van der Dussen moves on that side and takes a good catch. It looked easy but it was not an easy one to take as the ball was hit with power and it was rushing onto him. Stokes walks out to a standing ovation from the crowd. Finally the hosts have something to smile about this morning but is it too late already?"

South Africa look like a tamed lion at the moment and look out of sorts here. They have been trying to put a brake on the run flow rather than taking wickets but are struggling to contain as well. The game is slipping away from them and they need to find a way to put some sort of pressure on the visitors."

What a gem of a knock this has been from Sibley. Tossed up on the pads, Sibley gets down on one knee and sweeps it through backward square leg for a boundary to reach the milestone. All the English fans and his teammates are on their feet applauding the efforts of this young man. He removes his helmet, raises it along with his bat and has a huge smile on his face. He deserves all the applaud he is getting as he has put his side in a commendable position in this game."

Yes, they lost the wicket of Joe Root and Dominic Bess in the end but not before Root had done his job. They are leading by 264 and with 6 wickets in hand, they have a chance to bat South Africa out of this game. The day started with England finishing off the hosts' tail quickly and then batters had to do the job which they did. Sibley and Crawley started well but the latter fell soon after. Denly, then joined Sibley out in the middle and stitched a good partnership. After Denly's wicket, came a match-defining partnership between Root and Sibley. They stitched a 116-run stand to put the visitors right on top. Sibley has played an excellent hand and is close to reaching his maiden Test ton."

Bends his back and bowls a bouncer on middle and leg. Bess looks to fend it away but misses. De Kock behind the wicket pouches the ball and makes a loud appeal along with the slip cordon and the bowler. Not out says the umpire. Now, should South Africa opt for the review against the nightwatchman with just a minute left for Stumps? Well, Nortje, the bowler himself is not sure. Du Plessis and de Kock is confident though and the skipper eventually signals the 'T'. Interesting. Let's see what the replays show. Front foot is alright. Let's go to the business end now. Here comes Ultra Edge. Wow, a deflection off the gloves, detects the Ultra Edge. The umpire has to change his decision. Out it is and a very good review from South Africa. AND WITH IT, STUMPS ON DAY 3 AS WELL."

It has been a trend lately from him. Short delivery on off, Denly looks to pull but it takes the top edge and goes towards fine leg. Pretorius runs forward and tumbles to take an excellent catch. A slow-going but an excellent partnership comes to an end. South Africa would hope that this opens up the floodgates and gives them a chance in this game."

De Kock dives to his right and pouches it with both his hands in front of Rassie van der Dussen who was moving to his left. Rabada is ecstatic. Can they get another wicket before Lunch? Joe Denly walks out to bat at number 3, replacing the free-flowing Zak Crawley."

On his wicket, he says that it felt really bad. Tells that he will try to stay away from the game for a couple of days and then regroup for the next game. On Philander's last game at Newlands, and eventually his retirement post the series, de Kock says that he is a special player and that they will miss him in the dressing room.

England responded even better with Anderson and Broad being the pick of the bowlers. Anderson picked up a 5-fer as they got a lead of 46. Dominic Sibley, then in the second bout, registered his maiden Test ton and contributions from Big Ben and others gave a target of 438 to the Proteas which ultimately proved to be enough as the English Lions won the game by 189 runs."

Pieter Malan was the star for them with a brilliant 84 on his debut in the second innings. He along with Rassie van der Dussen, who played 140 balls for his 17 looked the most comfortable batters out there. The Proteas skipper would be disappointed with himself as he threw his wicket away. Just when de Kock and van der Dussen were making things look easy, the former played a poor shot and he too got out. Rassie van der Dussen soon followed with a strangle down the leg side and then it all went downhill. The last four wickets fell in quick succession and that gave the visitors a hard-fought victory."

Even Elgar's wicket did not stop the Proteas. Faf du Plessis and Quinton de Kock gave a fight but once the latter fell, England pounced upon that opportunity and finished things off quickly for the visitors. Despite Anderson being injured almost throughout the final session, the other bowlers bowled brilliantly especially Stokes in the end. He was the one with the three final wickets. Anderson picked up two wickets and all the other bowlers also chipped in with wickets. Overall, it was a very good performance from the visitors in the second innings."

It all started with the wickets of Quinton de Kock and Rassie van der Dussen who threw them away. Philander and Pretorius held fort for some time but then, it was the Ben Stokes show as he took two wickets off two balls. Philander was the last man to fall and that gave England the all-important victory, their first in this decade."

He puts his right hand out to grab it but the ball does not stick and pops up. He keeps his eyes on the ball and sees it coming down. He then puts his left hand up and takes it easily.

It was a clear trap and Rassie has completely fallen for it. A leg gully was in place and the ball has gone straight to him. Broad sprays this one down the leg side, van der Dussen gets tempted and looks to flick. He does so but the ball goes very fine for his liking. Rassie turns and watches Anderson take an easy catch. Van der Dussen is in distraught and so are his teammates in the pavilion. He walks back after a gritty and fantastic knock, facing 140 balls. Has he done enough to help his team drag this match to a draw? Only the remaining batters can complete the story now."

No maiden Test hundred for Malan but more importantly his marathon innings of 288 balls finally comes to an end. This is the wicket the visitors were craving for and they have finally got it. The ploy to give the new ball to Sam Curran has done the magic for Root. Curran comes over the wicket and hits the deck hard on off, it looks to be going away with the angle but this one straightens up after pitching and it also shoots a bit off the deck. Malan looks to defend but gets surprised by the bounce. He ends up getting a fat outside edge of his slant willow. It dies on its way to second slip. Ben Stokes standing there takes a very good catch, inches above the ground. The England players are up in celebration and Curran gets his first wicket of the innings and it is the big fish. South Africa have half their side back in the hut and the tourists are over the moon!"

The skipper though after setting his eyes in, got out playing a shot which one would feel was absolutely not needed. The good news for the hosts is that debutant Malan is still out there and has taken international Test cricket to fish like water. He is continuing his marathon knock and having faced 271 balls, he now finds himself just 17 short of getting his maiden Test ton on debut. He is joined by another inexperienced international Test batter, Rassie van der Dussen. The pair have managed to bat out till Lunch and would look to continue their good work after the break. Pieter Malan, on his first ever Test already holds the key for the hosts in this game."

The visitors managed to get rid of the nightwatchman earlier and then they had to work hard to get the Protea skipper but they will be happy with their efforts. Anderson was brilliant with the old ball at the start and rightfully got a wicket. Broad had a short spell but hardly troubled in it. Stokes bowled his heart out but was unable to reap the reward. Dominic Bess was the other bowler who got the dangerous Faf du Plessis. The visitors though would have liked one more. The visitors know that they will be made to work hard as Pieter Malan is still out there and Rassie van der Dussen has been doing his job to negotiate the new ball which is now just three overs old."

Now then, the England players think of a review but decide against it. Right decision in the end as the Ultra Edge shows that there there was no bat and it had gone off the thigh pad. With that, it is LUNCH ON DAY 5."

Against the run of play. The dangerous, the marathon man of South Africa, the Protea skipper, Faf du Plessis is out of here. Floated off spinner around off, Faf gets down on one knee and looks to sweep it with the spin. He hits it a bit uppishly and it goes straight towards Joe Denly at mid-wicket. He gets down to his right and takes a very good catch to get rid of the South African skipper. This could be the wicket England would have been craving for. The new ball is available in a short while and they have a new man out in the middle. The one thing Faf du Plessis would not have wanted was this, falling this way. England will once again have their tail up now. 274 runs more needed for the Proteas but England now 6 wickets away with 2 and almost a quarter of sessions still to play."

He was threatening towards the fag end of Day 4 and he has been threatening today morning also. This is another gem of a delivery from Anderson. One of the rare bowlers in modern day cricket who can generate good old reverse swing. Not as much as Wasim Akram used to do but enough to trouble the batter. This one starts around off. It looks to be shaping away but it comes back in. Maharaj looks to defend but misses and the ball hits him on the back pad. There is a huge appeal from the English players and the umpire is in agreement with them as he raises his finger. Keshav knows he is a candidate of plumb and with just one review remaining, the Proteas will not take the risk of using it with the nightwatchman. He starts walking back. South Africa need 309 more runs to win. England 7 wickets away from leveling the series."

Excellent decision from both the umpire and Joe Root. Good length ball pitching around off, it nips back in sharply. Malan looks to defend but the ball goes between the bat and pad to the keeper. It clips something as there is a noise. There is a huge appeal as the English players go up in appeal but the umpire turns it down. Root thinks of a review and opts against it. Good decision as Ultra Edge later on shows that the noise was of the ball hitting the back pad on its way to the keeper."

But part-timer, Joe Denly was the unlikely source who got them their first breakthrough. The ball started to do something towards the latter stages of the day. And when the ball talks, James Anderson roars, and he once again roared providing his team a prized scalp of Zubayr Hamza."

England were first dominant with the bat and ended up declaring with a massive lead of 437! Needing 438 to win, South Africa needed their openers to lay in a solid platform and build a big stand. The pair of Elgar and Malan did just that. The duo took their sweet time and calmly stitched a 71-run opening stand. Elgar failed to capatalize on his start, Hamza then joined Pieter out in the middle and continued from where Elgar left off. But just like Dean Elgar, Zubayr Hamza too fought hard but failed to stick around. Nightwatchman, Keshav Maharaj who had a torrid time with the ball then joined the well-set Malan and ensured that there were no further damage done."

There is a hint of movement, the ball is doing something, who do you turn to? Without any doubts, James Anderson. He makes the ball move just like he has done in his previous 150 Test matches. It is in the corridor of uncertainty around off. It shapes in off the deck, Hamza has to defend it and has no option to leave it. The ball takes a thick outside edge and goes to the right of the keeper. Buttler dives and takes a good catch. The ball did not move leaps and bounds, it just did a fraction. Fraction enough to get rid of Hamza. The norm of this Test match has been late wickets in the day and that is exactly what has happened now as well."

Flighted ball outside off, landing on the rough and spinning into the batsman. Elgar prods forward to defend but misses it. The English players appeal and after some thought, the umpire raises his finger. Elgar though is confident that he has not hit it at all so he goes for the review immediately. Replay rolls in and Ultra Edge shows that there is a feather on it as it shows a small spike as the ball goes past the bat. Elgar is shocked as he trudges back to the pavilion. Can't blame Elgar for this as it was the slightest of feather which he might not have felt. He was looking very good out in the middle but needed to continue for his side. Finally England have got their way past the South African opener. Will this trigger a couple more before the end of day's play?"

They have not scored at a very high run rate but the pair have taken their time and are fighting it out in the middle. The hosts will hope that the pair continues their good work after the break and bat the majority of the final session as well. England, on the other hand, have a good chunk of runs to play with but they cannot take it lightly and will need to strike a couple of wickets before the end of day's play. Part-timer Denly has used the rough and Root will hope Bess too can exploit that. Can the Proteas bat the day out without losing a wicket or will England strike in the final session of the day? Join us after the break to find out."

Length ball around off, nipping into the batsman. Malan looks to defend off the front foot, there are two noises as the ball goes to the right of the keeper. Buttler behind the stumps dives on that side and takes it just above the ground. Buttler along with the other English players put in a huge appeal but the umpire shakes his head. Stokes, Buttler, Sibley and Root all gather and have a brief chat but  Anderson is not interested at all. He starts going back for his run up. In the end, they opt against the review. Probably the last review made them not go for it for this one. Very good decision in the end not to go for the review and Anderson not being excited is justified as Ultra Edge rolls in later on and it shows that the ball had kissed the front pad and not the bat before clipping the back leg and going to the keeper. Hawk Eye then comes in and it shows that the impact was outside off and the wicket was missing too. It would have been disastrous as the tourists would have lost both their reviews so early in this innings."

The English core of Broad, Stokes, Buttler and Root have a word and in the dying moments Root takes it upstairs. Replay rolls in and first it shows Broad is clean as his front foot is inside the crease. Time for Ultra Edge and ... it shows a spike as the ball goes past the bat. There is a feather of an inside edge. It looked plumb but tell you what, the umpire has produced a world class decision. Can't blame Root for taking it upstairs. England lose one of their two reviews. Malan survives, so South Africa are spared off a disastrous start."
