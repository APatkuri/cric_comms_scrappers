Hanuma Vihari and Ishant sharma continued the good work after the Lunch break and led India to a total above 400. Vihari got to his first Test century in the process while Sharma played an innings like a top order batsman with a well deserved fifty. India would feel that they have got enough on the board. It was Agarwal and Kohli in the early part of the innings who were brilliant with the bat and the middle order continued to milk the bowlers to give them a very good score on this wicket."

Holder bowls this one full and just outside off, Vihari looks to clear the mid on fielder but gets a thick outside edge on it. The ball goes high in the air towards mid off where Kemar Roach runs back, settles himself under it and takes a good catch. India finish their first innings on 416 and have set a stiff total in front of the hosts."

But now, to add salt to the wound, the batsmen take an overthrow as well. It was a length ball just outside off, Vihari pushed this towards cover-point and set off for a single. Now, one cannot blame Ishant for not responding at all. He is a fast bowler and would have looked at the clock and probably thought, Lunch is around the corner. Suddenly, he is called for a quick single. Now, he is in no position to respond and starts scurrying towards the keeper's end. He knows he is gone and gives up pretty early when he sees Kraigg Brathwaite pick up the ball. The former skipper takes an aim and has a shy at the stumps at the striker's end, but on the run. That causes some imbalance and he misses it, with Sharma heaving a sigh of relief. The ball goes towards deep backward square leg and in the meantime, Vihari calls his partner for another run."

It is a flighted delivery on middle, Jadeja goes for the slog sweep over mid-wicket but gets a top edge on it which goes way up in the air. Darren Bravo at mid on positions himself under it and takes a simple catch. It was looking like Jadeja was itching to go for the big shot here and in doing so, he perishes. Cornwall provides the crucial breakthrough for the hosts."

On Virat Kohli's approach against the Windies bowlers, Bishop says that the batters have to be sharp and defend well. Bishop suggests that they need to wait for the loose deliveries and capitalise on them. The bowlers need to get their length right and hit the good length area consistently. The pitch is favouring the seamers and Ganga says that they will be crucial for both the sides."

Vihari and Pant are out in the middle and they will be looking to take this game out of the hosts' reach and take India's total around the 400-run mark.

The extra bounce does him as he does not get decent enough contact on it. It goes straight to Brooks at point and he takes a sitter there. India 2 down now on 46 and the hosts are back into the game."

Their batting was not upto the mark to say the least. Now coming into Day 3, their first target would be to avoid the follow-on. That looks fairly difficult with just three wickets in hand. Will they be able to produce any magic or will the visitors wrap the innings quickly? Join us in a while to find out."

If they do so, it will be nothing short of a miracle. Join us on Day 3 at 0930 local (1430 GMT).  Till then, cheers and take care!"

Pant had shuffled to his left early on and misjudged it while Rahane's dive to his left wasn't enough to reach it. The ball goes through them, and towards the third man fence. Cornwall is off the mark in streaky fashion."

The Indian players were not confident as they thought the batsmen was well in but the replays showed otherwise. Brooks was shown to be lazy in getting back and had he stretched a bit, he would have easily got in. Poor stuff. A run out is never the best way to get out (there never is any good way) but when you do not put a price tag on your wicket, you tend to lose respect."

Earlier, the landing of the foot was looked into only when the bowler was releasing the ball. However, as per the new rules, the landing of the foot is only checked, irrespective of the ball release. So the cameras show us replays of the Jadeja no ball. He lands his foot with his heel over the line. Fair. NO BALL. But he has not released the ball! And when he does let go of the cherry, the heel is back in the crease. So, what Murali Kartik is trying to tell us is - this rule is plainly for the fast bowlers as it is practically impossible to delay your delivery while bowling fast and landing your foot. But while adjusting to the faster men, the spinners are facing the brunt of the rule. Tough luck."

Brathwaite looks to defend by coming forward but the ball shapes a tad bit away. It kisses the outside edge of the bat and goes to Pant behind the wicket. Good start for India. Rishabh Pant becomes the fastest Indian wicketkeeper to reach 50 dismissals in Test cricket."
