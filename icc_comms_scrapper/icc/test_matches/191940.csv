Good length delivery outside off, Burns misreads it as the ball nips back in. Burns shoulders arms to it and the ball hits him high on his pads. Roach appeals but Dowrich behind the stumps is not as excited. Holder after a brief thought signals the 'T'. Replay rolls in and it shows the ball was clipping the stumps. Umpire's call and Burns survives a huge scare. West Indies do not lose a review. They have all three of their reviews intact. Not surprising to see Burns misread one because it has been a long break and a little bit of rustiness can be expected especially in the early stages.",,,,

Full delivery around off, which swings in sharply. Crawley looks to flick but misses and gets rapped on the pads. Holder and the rest appeal but the umpire shakes his head. Kettleborough gets across sideways to see where the ball has ended up, does an 'ooo' with his mouth but shakes his head. Holder is confident and goes for the review. Before the Ultra Edge rolls in, initially there is some confusion. Has the ball deflected off the bat? Nope. No deviation or spike on the Ultra Edge. The Ball Tracker shows all reds and Zak has to go. England are in deep trouble in their first innings and need their captain Ben Stokes to step up. But the question is - how will he play now?

Anderson, Stokes and Buttler all have a quick chat after which Stokes signals the 'T'. Anderson's foot is fine so we move onto Ultra Edge and there is no spike there. Is height going to be an issue? No, it's not as Ball Tracker comes in and shows all reds as the ball is going on to hit the middle and leg pole.
