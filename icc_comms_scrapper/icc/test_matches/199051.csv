Usually, when there is a delivery in such a channel, KL has been wary and has left it, but this time, he goes chasing after this and pays the price, as this delivery nipped away late and caught the edge. James Anderson runs in and serves a fuller ball, in the fourth stump channel, gets it to move away as well.

Root has a word with his bowler and the keeper. This time he goes for the referral in time. Remember, the impact won't be an issue here as the batter was not offering any shot. The Ball Tracker rolls in and it shows three reds. Huge roar from the English players, they have got an early success this morning and it's the big wicket of Pujara. Surely, there was an error in judgement from Cheteshwar Pujara, he was undone first by the fuller length and then by the extravagant inward movement. To worsen the situation, he was hit on the back pad.
