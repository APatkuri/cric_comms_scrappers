Electing to bat on a rain-marred first day, England chose to bat and their openers put together a 107-run stand. Post that, South Africa bounced back to claim four quick wickets last evening but failed to capitalize this morning. Joe Root and Ollie Pope settled into a handy stand to propel the visitors but then came a tsunami named Anrich Nortje. He breathed fire in his spell in the second hour of the first session and enforced a mini-collapse. The young bowler finished with a 5-wicket haul, his best effort in Test cricket."

In another game, England have already finished their contest, trouncing Nigeria by 8 wickets after bundling them out for 58.

It flies in the air at covers where Elgar runs back, keeps his eyes on the ball and pouches the skier safely. Buttler has thrown away his wicket and South Africa will be relieved that this partnership didn't hurt them much. Can they now restrict England under 325?"

Curran flashes his bat at it but only manages to edge a 145 kph ball. One thing was again missing - Footwork! A healthy edge is gobbled by Quinton de Kock and this is now Nortje's best effort in Test cricket. Take a bow, young man! What a spell! This will truly be the stepping stone of his Test career. We will have to wait to see his hat-trick ball as this splendid over has come to a close."

Faf moves across to his right swiftly, pouches the ball at first but then it pops out. Du Plessis is frustrated but spare a thought for this young bowler. He's giving his all in this spell and needs support from his teammates."

But he keeps his bat hanging out there needlessly and the ball catches the inside half before destroying the stumps. Anrich becomes rich by one more wicket in Tests and South Africa will be relieved to see Ollie's back. That little bit of indecision has cost him his wicket and a golden chance to score back-to-back hundreds."

Had he not taken that extra second to judge, he could have taken a well-judged catch. The Wanderers can be a difficult ground to sight the ball."

Bavuma charges in to the ball from backward point, dives and then throws it sideways, at the striker's end, with every inch of his body in the air. Ollie Pope dives to save himself. Anyone remembering David Warner here? He would certainly remember the way he was run out by Bavuma.

But once it stopped and made way for the day's play, we got to witness some engrossing Test cricket. Joe Root once again got lucky with the coin and his decision to bat first was backed by a fluent opening stand between Crawley and Sibley. When we thought that the hosts are going to be rolled over, they made a resounding comeback in the final session to hand the English team not one or two but four blows. In short, a smashing partnership was followed by a complete disintegration of the top order and that has put this Test in the balance after the first day. What will Day 2 bring? Stay tuned to find out..."

However, they would be more than happy from their performance in the third session. It looked like the visitors are in for a huge first innings total after the openers raked up a brilliant 100-run stand in the first session. However, that did not happen as the South Africans bounced back by sending 4 batters back to the pavilion for 50 runs. The 4 South African pacers, Philander, Paterson, Hendricks and Nortje took a wicket each and showed that there is something in the pitch for the bowlers as well. They managed to get rid of the dangerous and in-form Ben Stokes. Root, the English skipper, although did really well to see off the remaining overs through his unbeaten stand with Ollie Pope."

That is some achievement and it finally looks like England have found the solution to their opening batsmen woes. Crawley has taken the charge, scoring freely nd getting to his maiden half ton in the process. As for Sibley, he has been solid after getting a life as he was caught by Bavuma at backward point only for umpire Joel Wilson to rule that delivery as a no ball for overstepping. These are solid foundations for England and they would be looking to go big from here on in. Coming to the South African bowlers, they have been poor and not giving anything tough to the England batters to face. Can they turn it around in the final session of the day? Join us after the Tea break at 1600 Local (1400 GMT) for all the action!"

South Africa haven't been able to put too much pressure on the openers. They would've had one under their belt but Philander had overstepped and that might prove to be costly for them. Both the openers are looking solid out in the middle and would look to continue batting. Interesting to see if South Africa can manage to bag a wicket or two before the break."

The bowler though makes a loud appeal along with the keeper. The umpire takes his time and then raises his fingers. Sibley quickly takes the decision upstairs which means he is quite confident that he did not nick it. The replays roll in and confirm the same. The Ultra Edge detects nothing as the bat crosses the bat. The noise was off the ball hitting the thigh pad. So, the on-field decision has to be changed and Sibley stays. Excellent review from him."

It has been raining overnight in Johannesburg and the first session has already been washed out on Day 1. It will be interesting to see how the outfield will play out from now on. Now, for a quick rewind, the hosts did win the first Test match and gave the home fans some hope that this team was turning a corner but in the following 2 Test matches, England and especially, Ben Stokes, showed his class as they have now taken a 2-1 lead in the series. The 2nd Test match went to the final hour of the final day but in the 3rd Test, one must say it was men against boys as England romped to a victory. This Test match is a must-win for South Africa if they want to draw the series. As for England, they would be pleased with a draw but even they would be looking to win to get some extra points on the ICC World Test championship table. Coming to the team news, Kagiso Rabada, the main strike bowler for South Africa has been suspended for this Test match as he collected his 4th demerit point for his celebration after taking the wicket of Joe Root in the 3rd Test match. It is unknown as of now who will replace him in the bowling department. This will also be a farewell match for Vernon Philander and South Africa will be expecting that he delivers for them one last time. In the batting department, Zubayr Hamza will be replaced by Temba Bavuma and it will be interesting to see how he copes after not a very good tour of India. Coming to England, Mark Wood was a doubt for this game but it looks like he will be fit to make it to the starting XI. However, during the warm-up, Jofra Archer injured his elbow and looks like he will miss out and Chris Woakes will come on for him. Stay tuned for the Toss and pitch report."

They started well on Day 3 as well picking up the wicket of Vernon Philander in the first over of the day. Then came a partnership between Quinton de Kock and Dwaine Pretorius. Once Pretorius fell, it took the visitors few minutes to wrap up the innings. Mark Wood was the pick of the bowlers, picking up five wickets while Woakes and Stokes chipped in with two."

The hosts, on the other hand, would look upon Quinton de Kock to get them to 200 first and avoid the follow-on.

Faf discusses with Quinton and goes for the review. Woakes is fine on the no ball front. The Ball Tracker then comes in and it shows that it is umpire's call on hitting the stumps. Review retained but they lose their skipper. Woakes deserves this wicket as he has been brilliant since he came into the attack. Can South Africa survive without losing any more wickets till Stumps?"

They kept it simple and made the ball talk on a few occasions. Earlier, South Africa fluffed the chance of bowling England under 350 and they had to pay a heavy price for it as the last wicket pair of Broad and Wood frustrated them with an 82-run stand. An intriguing final session awaits us after the break. Do join us to find out how many overs more can the South African openers survive?"

Full ball around off, Root looks to whack it on the off side but gets a thick outside edge which flies to the right of gully. South African skipper, Faf du Plessis decides to show his flying skills and channel his inner Superman. He dives to his right, actually if you see it in real time, you will see him fly like Superman just without the cape and take a blinder with his right hand. People can talk about his age and poor run of form with the bat but boy this man fields like a 20-year old. Root's very good knock needed something special to come to an end and it has taken a spectacular effort to end it. ENGLAND ALL OUT FOR 248! With a lead of 465!"

Denly too did not last long but Sibley is still there out in the middle along with his skipper. The tourists have taken their lead past 300 and have further 8 wickets in hand. South Africa, on the other hand, need to plan some way to keep picking wickets. They are clearly on the back foot and need to find some source of inspiration. To add salt to their wounds, they have gone one bowler short as Vernon Philander is out with a hamstring injury. Pretorius and Paterson have been the bowlers to get one wicket apiece so far. Will England continue to call the shots and end the day on a high or will we see a fightback from the hosts? Join us after the break to find out."

De Kock and Paterson are convinced that he has edged that one. They ask du Plessis to go for the review and he obliges.

These two ended the century run opening stand drought for England in the first innings and are well on course to achieve that once again."

As for South Africa, the pressure continues to mount on skipper Faf du Plessis as his side fail to deliver and are losing by huge margins. They will need huge improvements in the coming months so that their transition can become smoother. For now, that is it from our side. Do join us for the ODI series that starts from the 4th of February, 2020. That game begins at 1300 Local (1100 GMT). Until then, cheers and take care!"

Nortje performed brilliantly as he came out with a 5-fer to his name. South Africa in reply scored a meager 183 runs. Quinton de Kock played an innings which saved his team from embarrassment as he scored 76 runs. Mark Wood picked up a 5-fer in the first innings and he ran through the Proteas' batting line-up. Woakes and Stokes chipped in with a couple of wickets each while Curran took one wicket. England did not enforce the follow-on and opted to bat. However, they did not play well with only skipper Joe Root scoring more than 50 runs as they finished on 248. Debutant Beuran Hendricks bowled superbly to bag a 5-fer and give his team a slim chance in the game."

The most promising time for the Proteas came when Rassie van der Dussen and skipper Faf du Plessis were batting and stitched a 92-run stand. However, Stokes dismissed the South African skipper and that opened the floodgates for them. Van der Dussen played a brilliant knock of 98 runs but it went in vain as he departed soon after his skipper. After the Tea break, it was almost inevitable that England would win. Bavuma and de Kock played some strokes to cheer the fans up as they made a 48-run stand but once Bavuma departed, South Africa collapsed from 235/4 to 274 all out."

However, Ben Stokes came and once again provided the pivotal breakthrough of Faf du Plessis which shook the confidence of South Africa. In the very next over, Rassie van der Dussen fell after a brilliant innings and that has now opened the floodgates for England. Two new batters in the form of Quinton de Kock and Temba Bavuma are at the crease with the latter looking shakier than ever. Join us for the last session of Day 4 and possibly the whole series at 1530 Local (1330 GMT) as England will be looking to come out all guns blazing!"

Seeing the length, van der Dussen's eyes lit up and he goes for the expansive cover drive. He does not time it perfectly and it goes a touch uppishly to the right of Stuart Broad who tumbles low in that direction to take a good catch. Wood deserves this wicket more than anyone as he has been bowling well all day. Van der Dussen misses his ton by two runs and England get two wickets in two overs."

Buttler there takes the catch and immediately goes up in appeal. The umpire shakes his head. Root straightaway signals the 'T' because he definitely heard something there. The replays roll in to show that yes, it did hit something but it was not the bat or the glove, and instead it was the elbow. Faf continues to fight it out in the middle for himself and the team."

Rassie van der Dussen walked in then, and he combined with the southpaw Dean Elgar to stitch a 50-run stand. However, right before the Lunch break, Stokes was again in the thick of things as he dismissed Elgar and England returned to the pavilion with smiles on their faces. South Africa would have loved if Elgar could have kept his wicket intact but it was not to be."

He bends his back and bowls a very good short ball. The speed gun shows it is bowled at 136 kph but in real-time it looked quick. It is very close to Elgar's body and the ball skids off the surface. Elgar is hurried onto the pull and all he can do it lob it back to Stokes who takes an easy catch. Just when it looks like South Africa are onto something England put a brakes on it and dampen all the hopes. The pitch is hardly doing anything but Stokes once again shows why he is held in high regards and produces something special."

Full and wide outside off, Malan goes chasing after it like a kid chasing candy. He ends up getting a thick outside edge which goes to the right of Ben Stokes. You cannot keep him out of the game and he takes a good catch. Catching practice at slip for Big Ben. The steady opening stand has been taken down."
