Do not see a result possible unless an innings is forfeited by both the sides but don't see that happening. Lanka will hope they can somehow bundle Pakistan out for a very, very low score, they though will have to do that twice. The visitors are probably the only team that can win from here but if they do so, it would be nothing more than a shock."

After a long break, session 2 started but only for a few overs as bad light arrived to cut short the day. What happened on Day 3 then? A delayed start because of the overnight rain. Nothing happened in session 1. Finally, the second session started but lasted only 32 balls as players were taken off due to poor light. And, it never improved and that was curtains on Day 3. Now, what will happen on Day 4? Timely start or a delayed one? Well, let me give the bad news first up. There's been overnight rain and it's drizzling in Rawalpindi on and off and we are surely not going to start on time. But, well, we've been hoping against hope in the last couple of days so, let's hope again that we get action on Day 4. That's all we can do."

However, because of overnight rain, the covers are on and we are probably in for a delayed start. Let's hope once the game starts, rain stays away from Rawalpindi and allows us to enjoy the return of Test cricket in Pakistan. If that happens, Dhananjaya de Silva who's batting on 72 would look to take his side towards a decent first innings total while the Pakistan bowlers would hope to take the remaining 4 wickets as quickly as possible. What's on the cards? We will soon find out."

Also, just to inform everyone who were surprised because of the exclusion of Yasir Shah, there is news regarding the spinner. The PCB has released him from the squad so that he can work with spin consultant Mushtaq Ahmed at NCA. He will be joining the team before the start of the second Test in Karachi. Apparently, as per the PCB, Mushtaq Ahmed was appointed as spin bowling consultant last week. According to his contract, he will work 120 days in a year at the National Cricket Academy with the U16, U19 and other domestic bowlers. As and when required, he will work with the national team."

Before things can go out of hands, Mathews and de Silva added 62 runs between them to pull things back. Mathews fell for 31 before poor light came into the picture to shorten the day. Now, will the lights allow us to get through the entire second day's play? Let's hope so. But what about the rain gods? Will they allow the day to start and then continue or will they play a spoilsport? Let's hope not and we witness a full day's play and another engrossing one too."

For hours, nothing seems to happen in this Test and all of a sudden, someone plays a poor shot and a wicket falls. Pace has done the trick. A length ball outside off, Mathews looks to punch it on the up but is beaten by pace. The ball zips through, takes the outside edge and flies at a good height to second slip where Asad Shafiq takes it nicely. The 62-run stand has been broken."

Sri Lanka would be unhappy with their effort as after a solid opening stand of 96 runs they crumbled. Their approach has been ultra defensive and have struggled to add runs along with losing wickets. The visitors need to rebuild and the current pair needs to hang in there and take their side out of troubled waters. Can the pair manage to achieve it or will Pakistan build on the momentum they got in this session? Join us after the break for the third and final session of the day."

Mathews is outfoxed by it and ends up flicking it uppishly but luckily that falls in no man's land away from the man at short mid-wicket. Dramatic way to end the session. That will be Tea on Day 1."

Kusal Mendis strides forward to defend but ends up getting a thick outside edge and goes straight into the mitts of the keeper. Rizwan takes an easy-peasy. Usman Shinwari is up in celebration. A wicket he will never forget. Third bowler to get into the wickets column. Pakistan have their tail up now."

Dimuth looks to defend but he misses and the ball hits him low on the pads. The Sri Lankan skipper opts to take it upstairs. Replay rolls in and though it looks like it might be missing the stumps, Ball Tracker shows all reds and Karunaratne has to walk back. Big wicket for Pakistan. Karunaratne was looking set for a big one but he departs. Can this inspire the hosts who have been timid so far in this Test?"

He is late, as he is deep inside the crease and makes a tentative push towards cover. The ball, as a result, exposes the gap between bat and pad. Almost sneaks through but takes the inside edge and whizzes past the leg stump towards fine leg. A run taken."

Full and outside off, 129.6 kph, coming in, Oshada gets a big stride and then shoulders arms. The ball hits his pads and up go all the Pakistan players, asking the question. Impact does not matter in this case as Fernando is not offering a shot. But perhaps it was not coming back enough to hit the stumps. One of the rare good deliveries this morning."

Sri Lanka won the toss on Day 1 and elected to bat, they put up a good first innings score with Dhananjaya being their star with a ton. He came out to bat on Day 1 and scored his ton on Day 5. The Lankans declared immediately after he got to his ton. Pakistan then had their chance to bat and enjoyed their opportunity. Especially Azam and Abid. Both scored tons and ensured the fans who came into watch the game, had their money's worth."

More of the same is what Pakistan would like in post Lunch whereas, Sri Lanka would hope for a few early wickets. Join us in a while for the afternoon session."

A length delivery around off, it angles away. Masood looks to defend but the ball goes off the outside edge and towards gully where Perera seems to have taken a low catch. An appeal but the umpire is not sure. He has a chat with the other umpire and then takes it upstairs. Replays roll in and guess what? Rajitha oversteps. No need of moving ahead as it is not a legal delivery. Also, the ball did not carry so it would have remained not out."
