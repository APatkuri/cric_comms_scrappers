Anyway, it is time for both teams to move on as they will be in action soon. Afghanistan\u00a0will now head to Sharjah as they host South Africa for a three-match ODI series beginning on the 18th of September. New Zealand\u00a0will continue their subcontinental tour as they head to Sri Lanka for a two-match Test series, which will also start on the 18th of September. You can switch tabs and check the complete schedule and tune in to our coverage on matchday as well. Till then, take care and goodbye!",

The evening and overnight rains have been key and the outfield simply isn't fit to play cricket and neither side would want to risk their players. There's not much anyone can do apart from hope that there is no further overnight rain and we are able to kick off the Test match on Day 3. Day 3 will officially start at 4 am GMT but you can join us an hour in advance for the build-up and the latest playing conditions. Cheers!",

                    "Commentary": "Cricketing action continues all across the globe and now, Afghanistan welcome New Zealand for a one-off Test match in India. The Greater Noida Sports Complex Ground will play host to this historic Test match as the Kiwis embark on a journey of 6 Test matches in the next couple of months in the subcontinent, a first for them as they have never played more than three Tests in the subcontinent in the same year. Given New Zealand's record of just 16 wins out of 90 in the subcontinent, Kane Williamson and his men will be itching to turn things around and pick up crucial away victories. Neither side has played a game since the T20 World Cup a few months ago now and Afghanistan will be looking to put the heartache of a semifinal loss behind them and start afresh. Hashmatullah Shahidi will lead Afghanistan as he has done in this format and Rashid Khan's absence from the Test side continues as he has taken a break from the longest format of the game due to medical advice. With no Noor Ahmad or even Mujeeb in the team, Qais Ahmad becomes their lead spinner for this game. Zahir Khan is the other spinner who will have a big role to play with the inexperienced likes of Shams Ur Rahman and Zia-ur-Rehman also in the side. Ibrahim Zadran will be vital for them up top and the likes of Hashmatullah Shahidi and Rahmat Shah will provide stability in the middle order and Azmatullah Omarzai will be expected to be at his best in that all-rounder role which is pretty crucial to Afghanistan's chances. New Zealand on the other hand seem to have a pretty strong squad, one that is fairly seasoned in playing in India. Skipper Kane Williamson will certainly will be the one to watch out for but the likes of Daryl Mitchell, Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra can all take the game away from the opposition on their own. The spin attack seems to be bolstered as well with the likes of Mitchell Santner, Ajaz Patel and Michael Bracewell in the mix and then the likes of Ravindra and even Glenn Phillips can roll their arm over and get crucial breakthroughs. On paper, New Zealand have a well-balanced side for such conditions and given the amount of newbies in the Afghan side, coupled with their frontline spinners missing from the squad, it will be difficult for the hosts to get the win. However, they have been prolific in subcontinental conditions and might just be able to give the Kiwis a run for their money. Who are you backing to clinch this exciting red-ball contest?",
