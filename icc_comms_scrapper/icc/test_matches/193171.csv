He survived an inswinging delivery early in this over but this time his luck has ran out. Very good ball this from Kumara. Fast and swinging in from around off. Abid looks to defend but misses and the ball hits him on the front pad. There is a huge appeal and the umpire raises his finger. Abid has a word with Babar, they discuss for a while and then in the dying seconds he signals the 'T'. Replay rolls in and Ultra Edge first shows no involvement of bat. Ball Tracker then comes up next and it shows all red as the ball was hitting the middle stump. Crucial wicket for the visitors, Abid was looking very good out in the middle and one would feel this wicket has come against the run of play.",True,11024,,
