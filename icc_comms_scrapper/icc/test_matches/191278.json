The umpires still have a look and it shows his feet touched the ropes when he palmed it away. Full marks for the effort and honesty there for Ajaz. Dhananjaya moves to 98 now."

Short and quick on off, Dilruwan expects it to spin and so he goes onto his back foot to play it on the off side. The ball though keeps straight and skids of the surface. Perera misses his shot and gets hit on the pad. Huge appeal follows and the umpire raises his finger. Dilruwan has a chat with Dhananjaya. After a brief chat, he opts to take it upstairs. Replays roll in and Hawk Eye shows that the ball would have gone on to clip the stumps. Dilruwan walks back but does not take the review with him. First wicket for Ajaz in this game."

On being asked if the rotation of strike irritates him, Trent admits that the Sri Lankan players know the ground and conditions better. Adds that it is difficult as a seamer to bowl in these conditions as there is very little swing available. Trent further adds that playing in different conditions has given him an idea how to bowl in different conditions. On his 250 Test wickets, Boult says that he is happy to achieve this feat but hopes to get more wickets."

No, they have not batted 150 overs or more they have just batted for just 66 overs so far. In one session we got on Day 2, it was the Kiwis who dominated. They have put Sri Lanka on the back foot and will look to wrap up the tail as quickly as possible. Dhananjaya de Silva holds the key for the hosts and the onus will be on him if they are to reach close to 250. The day looks brighter than the 2 days we have got in this Test.

Full ball outside off, Dimuth has been leaving those but on occasions when he has gone for the drive he has missed and been lucky but this time Lady Luck has evaded him. He goes for the drive but ends up getting a thick outside edge which goes to the left of the wicketkeeper. BJ Watling moves across to that side and takes a simple catch. End of a fabulous innings from the skipper. He will be gutted not to get another century."

New Zealand players put in a huge appeal and the umpire agrees. Perera and Dimuth have a discussion and they opt against the review. Good decision as that looked plumb to the naked eye. Hawk Eye shows that Kusal Perera would have had to continue his walk as the ball was going onto clip the stumps. But one cannot leave such ball on a sub-continental wicket as the ball does not bounce here as much as other countries."

In the little play we got, it was once again a closely fought contest. Yes Sri Lanka have lost two wickets but their star batter and skipper, Dimuth Karunaratne is still fighting it out in the middle. He is joined by the experienced Angelo Mathews. The duo holds the key here for the hosts. New Zealand, on the other hand, will be looking to break this stand and put the inconsistent middle order of Sri Lanka to test. Early blows will be vital here. The question is can New Zealand get through the defenses of Dimuth and Angelo? The weather once again looks dodgy for the day but as a cricket fan one can just pray and hope that the rain gods have mercy."

They have a bit of a bad news, with Akila Dananjaya reported for suspect bowling action. But he still has 14 days to play before the official verdict comes out. Dilruwan Perera looks likely to come in place of him. The visitors, on the other hand, will now look to get their campaign underway in this ICC World Test Championship. New Zealand were good in bits and pieces in the last game and their inability to win the crucial situations led to their downfall. It will be interesting to see if New Zealand make any changes or go with the same eleven. A crucial game for the Kiwis as if they fail to win this, they will find themselves lacking behind the pack in the standing. Apart from the weather everything looks exciting. If the rain gods don't interfere then we are up for another ride. Who will come out on top? Stay tuned to find out as the toss is not far away."

Post the dismissal of Latham, Colin de Grandhomme batted aggressively and we witnessed yet another century stand to help New Zealand take a handy lead. Sri Lanka started well with the ball but failed to maintain the same intensity. Also, it was tough to adjust to the stop-start nature of the game due to all the rain. 91 overs to go in the day, let's wait and find out the approach of the Lankan batsmen. The onus is on New Zealand to take the initiative as Sri Lanka have the lead in this series and won't mind a draw here. Stay tuned for their reply."

The duo were cautious in their approach but once Latham got out, de Grandhomme came in and played his natural attacking game. He decimated the Sri Lankan bowlers and got to his 50 in just 45 balls taking his side's lead over 100, 114 to be precise. Before rain disrupted play for a while. Once play resumed, it seemed like the halt brought a lapse in concentration for the duo, especially Colin de Grandhomme as he was unable to score as freely as before that. The biggest surprise though was Kane Williamson did not call off his batters and continued to let them play. With a lead of 138, it will be interesting to see how many overs the Kiwi batters bat."

The Kiwis have scored 99 runs in this session and are looking solid. With the lead now 51 and New Zealand desperately looking for a win, it will be interesting to see what Williamson does after the break. Sri Lanka need to find a way to pick up wickets and also stop the run flow which is slowly gathering pace. What do we have in store for the final session of Day 4? Join us after the break to find out. 27 overs are scheduled for the day. Will Sri Lanka get to bat today?"

The ball hits him on the back pad. The Sri Lankan players put in a solid appeal and the umpire agrees. Latham after a brief chat with Watling signals a hopeful 'T'. Replay rolls in and Snicko shows no bat. Hawk Eye comes in next and it shows all reds as the ball would have gone onto hit the leg stump. Latham has to walk back. End of a fantastic knock from Tom. He walks off to a round of applause from the fans. This will be a knock he would remember for a long time as it is not an easy pitch to bat but he made it look easy, scoring more than half the runs for his side."

Seeing that, Watling calls Latham for a single but then sends him back as he feels he will not make it in time. Latham goes back and now, thanks to the yelling, de Silva is guided to throw to the bowler. But the throw is a wild one and the ball goes all the way to long on! Two overthrows in total."

Bowl out Sri Lanka for 100 and then chase it down on the final day. OR. Sri Lanka run riot after Tea, bowl the Kiwis out within an hour, bat till Tea tomorrow and then declare, setting a target of 250. If either of these happens, it will be FUN. Else, a draw is very much likely on the cards. Join us back at 3.15 pm local (0945 GMT)."

Flighted delivery on off, Latham gets down on one knee and sweeps it through the square leg region for a boundary. Subdued celebrations from him as he knows the job is not done yet. He will now look to convert this into a big one."

Starting the day with the Sri Lankan scorecard reading 144/6. It looked like 200 would be an achievement for them but Dhananjaya de Silva had other ideas. Having lost Dilruwan Perera early, de Silva fought with the tail, batted smartly too. First he added 43 with Lakmal, then a small 10-run stand and then a vital 20-run stand to take the Sri Lankan total close to 250 and getting his 5th Test hundred in the process."

On stop-start days due to plenty of rain interruptions, it was not easy for anyone and that's why these knocks from Latham, Watling and de Grandhomme were extra special. After earning a good lead this morning, the onus was on their bowlers to do some magic. They initiated superbly and reduced the Lankan team to half in no time. Karunaratne and Dickwella fought for some time but that wasn't enough. Dickwella did frustrate the Black Caps along with Suranga Lakmal for 107 balls but the visitors hung in there and eventually pulled out a memorable win, their biggest against Sri Lanka."

The ball loops in the air and Latham moves across to his left in anticipation from forward short leg to grab a fine reflex catch. Dickwella is frustrated with himself. New Zealand celebrate. They can smell a win here, only 1 wicket more left to pick."

It hits the deck outside off and breaks back in to kiss the gloves of Lakmal who was trying to defend. It then brushes his pads and lobs to Latham at forward short leg. He takes the simplest of catches and Sri Lanka lose their eighth wicket. The Kiwis are relieved. 25.3 overs left in the Test match to pick the remaining two wickets."

Another 36 overs left in the day and with the rain gods knocking on the door, it's going to be an exciting finish. Do join us in a short while."

Pacy yorker on leg, Dilruwan looks to defend but the ball hits him on his boot after pitching just in front. The Kiwi players put in a loud and confident appeal. The umpire though is unmoved. Boult is dead sure that he has his man. Kane Williamson quickly takes the review. Replay rolls in, first it shows that there was no bat involved. Then we go to the Ball Tracker and it shows that the ball was pitching marginally outside leg. Dilruwan survives but credit to the umpires here. Both Michael Gough and Bruce Oxenford have been absolutely brilliant in this game with their decisions."

His willow is hiding behind his front pad as the ball pings him. The appeal is made and umpire Bruce Oxenford raises his finger. Karunaratne takes his time and then goes for the DRS. The replays roll in. Impact cannot be an issue here as it will be counted as no shot offered. After that, the ball is seen to be moving in enough to rattle the sticks in the Ball Tracker. Karunaratne trudges back and the Kiwis have finally broken the stubborn resistance. 4 wickets more to level the series!"

It looks like it has come off the bat. There is a huge appeal after Taylor catches the ball at first slip and the umpire raises his finger. Karunaratne takes the review straightaway. Replays roll in and they show the bat has hit the pad and the ball lobs off the front pad. No edge there, so the initial appeal is nullified. Adding to that, the third umpire feels no need to check for the lbw as the impact is outside off and Dimuth was playing a shot as well. The on-field decision has to be overturned and Karunaratne survives. Very good review by the Lankan skipper."

Poor calling, rash shot selection and some brilliant bowling have brought about a serious downfall of the Lankan batting. In a match where draw was looking inevitable, it looks like we will have a result. The positive for Sri Lanka is their skipper, Dimuth Karunaratne and wicketkeeper, Niroshan Dickweela are out in the middle and can bank on them to take them out of this mess. How fit the skipper is?

The ball though drifts away from the batsman and then turns in after landing to cut Mendis' defense into pieces. It goes on to hit the top of off pole, a sight that all the bowlers love. New Zealand needed something special to get rid of Kusal Mendis and Somerville has pulled the rabbit out of his hat. Half the side down now before Lunch. The hosts are crumbling down like a jenga here. At this point of time, Sri Lanka will wish for two things, their skipper to stuck out in the middle and the heavens to open up."

But he ends up getting nothing but a thick  outside edge due to the extra bounce which goes to the left of the keeper. Watling makes no mistake and takes an absolute sitter. Two down in no time and Sri Lanka look like crumbling. Kusal Perera bags a pair in this Test match."

Thirimanne also has to run 'round the bowler which costs him valuable seconds. Ajaz Patel is quick to get to the ball, he dives and scores a direct hit at the bowler's end. The New Zealand players start celebrating. The umpire nods his head in agreement but still goes upstairs to be doubly sure. Replays roll in and they find Thirimanne to be well short of his crease.
