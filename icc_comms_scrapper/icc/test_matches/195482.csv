He bowls one around off and Ashwin who is caught on the back foot within the crease can only manage to get a faint tickle behind to the keeper. Tim Paine there takes the catch and goes up in an appeal joined by his bowler. The umpire too raises his finger after the appeal. Ashwin though is not convinced and challenges the decision taking it to third umpire. Replays roll in and it is a legal delivery as we move to HotSpot but nothing  on it though. Now we move to RTS and there is a spike as the ball goes past the outside edge. Keep walking Ashwin there.,2020-12-19T05:11:42+00:00,59641,Hanuma Vihari,26/8,0,0,True,4555,,caught wicket keeper,cwk,,
