I had written it is a surprise to many but he has delivered by ending this frustrating stand. A masterstroke by the skipper. Once again, Labuschagne lands it in the rough outside off. It pitches and turns back in sharply. Leach looks to work it on the leg side but due to the extra bounce, it hits the handle and lobs towards Wade who takes it nicely at short leg.

Marvelous scenes out there as AUSTRALIA HAVE RETAINED THE ASHES! Overton's fighting innings comes to an end. It is Josh Hazlewood who gets the last wicket. A good nut. It lands on off and jags back in. Overton looks to defend but misses to get hit on the front pad. A huge appeal. It looked a touch high but up goes the finger. Overton has no choice but to review. He signals the 'T'. Time for the replays. Ultra Edge shows no bat. Time for the Ball Tracker and it shows the ball to be hitting the leg pole. Australia continue to celebrate. THEY WIN BY 185 RUNS AND LEAD THE SERIES 2-1!,,,True,57368
