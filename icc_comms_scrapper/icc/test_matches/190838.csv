'He will let the short ball go if he is playing for the World XI. But he can also play the pull shot while featuring in the World XI.' He mentioned this twice in the span of 5 minutes and it has worked. The jinx. The trick. Either ways, if you live by the sword, you need to be prepared to die by it as well. The ploy to go after Archer has backfired. Could du Plessis have held himself back in these final few minutes? But then, when you are in overdrive, it is very difficult to get back into first gear. And that is exactly what has transpired. Quick and back of a length delivery on middle, Faf instinctively goes for the pull but takes his eyes off the ball. He is on a knee while trying to pull that. That looks good in T20s or while featuring in the death overs of an ODI innings. But in this format, it seems pretty audacious, to be honest. And invitation of extreme criticism if you fail to pull it off. Faf is not in control while playing the pull and as a result, the ball hits the top half of his bat. It is not cleanly struck and the ball goes towards deep backward square leg. Sam Curran comes running in from fine leg and takes a good catch. Faf shakes his head while smiling at the same time. Big mistake. Jofra wins the battle. Just conceded a few runs in the process but he has got his side in a realistic chance to win this game now. 165/4 is the effective score.

He pitches the ball up outside off. De Kock lunges forward and looks to defend but the ball tails away just a tad and kisses the outside edge of Quinton's willow. There is an appeal from the keeper and Stokes but surprisingly it is not a loud one. The bigger surprise is de Kock does not wait for umpire's decision and starts walking. This is very good sportsmanship from de Kock. In the age of DRS you hardly see players being honest and walk away without the umpire raising their finger. End of another counter-attacking knock from de Kock. He has been taking on the charge but surprisingly it's the defensive stroke that he has been dismissed off in both the innings. The lack of enthusiasm and energy from England after picking up that wicket does not put up a good sign. The lead is 323 now.,True,28035,,

Rassie van der Dussen, of course, because he has put a sitter down. But then, was it really a sitter? Imagine that you are playing a gaming console wherein you have to shoot at a target. You concentrate, aim and then fire. But suddenly, a bird flies out of nowhere just in front of the target. What are the chances of you missing your shot? Pretty close to 100 percent. Unless you are Orlando Bloom in Lord Of The Rings. But jokes apart, this was a very difficult chance for Rassie. Will explain why. Good length ball on middle and off, Burns looks to push at it but the ball moves away at the last moment. That squares him up totally and he gets an outside edge towards first slip. Now, it is a pretty straightforward chance to Rassie van der Dussen over there, to his right. But at that same moment, Quinton de Kock dives to his left to go for the catch. Understandably, that blinds Rassie, causing him to drop it. The ball drops down and goes into the fine leg fence for a boundary. How costly will that prove to be?",,,True,

Good length ball pitching around off and coming back in. Denly looks to flick it across the line but misses. There is a huge appeal from the Proteas players and the umpire agrees with him and raises the finger. Joe Denly has a word with his skipper and then signals the 'T'. Replay rolls in and Hawk Eye shows that the pitching is not an issue. The impact is in line as well and the ball is clipping the leg pole.
