Good length ball outside off, Jayed looks to guide it to third man but the ball goes off his outside edge towards Rohit Sharma at second slip. He makes a mess of it and has no idea where the ball has gone. Luckily for him, the ball lands straight into the hands of Pujara at first slip.

Ishant Sharma bowls it on a length around off, the ball swings a bit late. Mahmudullah looks to defend it but the ball takes the outside edge and goes towards first slip. Saha, the local lad, dives to his right and takes a stunning catch inches above the ground with just one hand. Bangladesh lose their sixth wicket and slip further and further."

Shadman looks to defend it but the sneaks past the bat and pad going to Wriddhiman Saha who dives to his right to take the catch. The Indians appeal but the umpire shakes his head. Shami and Saha look confident and convince Kohli to go for the review. The Ultra Edge rolls in and it shows that there is clearly no bat on it. The ball has gone off the thigh pad and into the keeper's gloves. Both teams lose a review very early on in the game. What a start to the spell from the local lad, Mohammed Shami."

Both sides enter pastures new as they make their debut in Day-Night Test. The hosts would look to continue their dominance and inflict another whitewash in Tests. Unsure of how much factor dew will play, it will be interesting to see whether India go for their tried and tested formula of 2 spinners at home or will they remove one of them. Bangladesh, on the other hand, will have to be at their brilliant best it they are to surprise the cricketing world. It will be interesting to see whether or not they make any changes to their side after a horror show at Indore. In a filled Eden Gardens, can the Bangla Tigers roar so loud that it makes everyone else silent or will India continue their dominance?"

Al-Amin Hossain, Abu Jayed and Ebadot Hossain picked 8 wickets among themselves but failed to create the kind of impact Bangladesh would have wanted. Now, it's up to their batsmen to show some fight and resilience against the lethal pace battery of India. They have a deficit of 241 to negate first. Do join us in a short while."

Kohli's brilliant innings comes to an end. He walks off with a smile as even he cannot believe what has happened.

Their lead has zoomed to a significant number in India's cricket history (183) and they have closed almost all the doors on Bangladesh. Only saving grace for the visitors was the wicket of Ajinkya Rahane and apart from that they were substandard with their bowling and fielding. Currently going through the motions, Bangladesh need a spark of inspiration from somewhere. Will it come after Lunch? Do join us at 1540 local (1010 GMT) for the second session."

Al-Amin was the other bowler to get into the wickets column. It will be another long day for the visitors if they don't manage to keep picking up wickets."

They initially bowled out Bangladesh for just 106 and then they have managed to finish the evening's play with a lead of 68. The hosts lost the openers relatively early but the duo of Pujara and Kohli added 94 runs. Both got to their respective half tons but Pujara once again failed to convert his start. The Indian skipper and his deputy have added unbeaten 37 runs and would look to add more on Day 2."

The Bangla team should look at the way Mushfiqur Rahim gutted it out in the middle and learn from the best they have in the dressing room. Their bowling cannot be faulted much as they did bowl their hearts out and all their pacers were impressive in patches. They should be looked after well back home where Bangladesh only concentrate on making spinning decks and completely ignore the fast bowlers. You cannot expect them to turn up without much exposure overseas and deliver the goods. To win a Test match you need to pick 20 wickets and there has to be a proper balance between pace and spin in the bowling attack. Quicker they learn better it will be for them.

Bangladesh were overwhelmed on the first day of the pink-ball Test. They were shot down for just 106 and from there on it was only catch up for them. The Indian batting didn't waste much time in adjusting to the 'alien conditions' and powered by Virat Kohli's century, they amassed a big first inning's lead. The story of Bangladesh's batting didn't change the second time around as well and apart from Mushfiqur Rahim and Mahmudullah to an extent, no one showed the stomach for a fight. Ishant Sharma was the standout performer with the ball and finished with a 9-wicket haul in this Test while Umesh Yadav wasn't too far behind with 8 wickets."

It possibly goes off his pads towards fine leg and they cross. Umpire Erasmus waits for the Indian skipper to take a call on the DRS and once the time runs out, he signals it as leg byes. Now then, the replays are shown and the impact is found to be in line so Saha is wrong with his advice and Jadeja has been robbed off a wicket here."

Sharma has now taken 9 wickets in the match and would be eyeing his second 10-wicket haul in Tests on Day 3."

Adds that once the lights are on, it becomes challenging for the batsmen and feels that the first session is best for batting as there isn't a lot of lateral movement. Tells that the twilight period has always been challenging and it becomes slightly easier in the third session due to the dew setting in. Mentions that as a batting unit you try to play positive cricket and then cash in later on. States that he is enjoying watching the pacers bowl from gully, both with the red ball and the pink one. On his dropped catches, Rahane replies that he has to take it in a positive way as it happens in cricket and attitude matters a lot after dropping a catch. Feels that they still have to come hard at Bangladesh and not look too far ahead as cricket is a funny game."

Mushfiqur Rahim has led the charge with a fine knock and his partnership with Mahmudullah would have given some relief and sense of respect to the dressing room. They somewhat recovered from 13/4 but then the injury to Mahmudullah cut short their brief resistance. Still, it was a session full of runs as the touring party scored 145 runs in it at a brisk pace. Had their top order shown some resilience and skill, Bangladesh could have been in a fighting position heading into Day 3."

Looking at the Indian skipper's reaction after taking the catch, it seems that Kohli picked the ball very late but still manages to hold onto it. He gets up sticking his tongue out and a cheeky smile. Catching the pink ball under lights, especially in the slip cordon, ain't easy. Bangladesh falling like nine pins."

Maybe, that hit on the head was still replaying in his mind. He could have either left it or pulled it with more conviction. But that fear didn't allow him to get on top of the bounce properly.

Virat Kohli decided to declare after a lead of 241. Having lost 4 wickets for 23 runs the movement of the pink ball under lights might have also played a part in his decision. It proved to be a good call as the new ball did move viciously for India as well. Ishant Sharma managed to get two wickets in the 5 overs they bowled and also scared the visitors with his sharp bouncers. Bangladesh have a mammoth task in hand as they are still staring down at a big deficit and have already lost Shadman Islam and skipper Mominul Haque. Can Bangladesh fight out the day/evening or will this be the last day of this historic Test? Join us after the break to find out."

Mithun is staying. Around 3 minutes left on the clock for Tea."

The Indian players appealed and the finger went up. Shadman decided to refer the decision but it's of no use. The third umpire found the impact to be in line of the off stump and then it was shown to be tickling the off pole. Umpire's call stays. Only saving grace for Bangladesh is that they didn't lose their review."
