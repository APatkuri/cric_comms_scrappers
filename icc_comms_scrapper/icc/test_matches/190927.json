Muthusamy should have had Kohli's wicket when the Indian skipper was on 208 but that was not to be as the spinner overstepped. Keshav Maharaj had a long spell but just a wicket to show for it. Muthusamy too picked up one in the end. Rabada was the standout bowler with three wickets."

After Mayank Agarwal with his century and Pujara with his fifty set the platform. Kohli built on that with Rahane. First he continued, last night's good work with sides vice captain. Once Rahane got dismissed, the Indian skipper joined hands with Ravindra Jadeja. The duo added a massive 225-run stand with Kohli not just getting to his 100 but then going onto convert it into 250. Jadeja after taking his time, took the charge and fell just 9 short of a well deserved ton."

India going on strong but they are still giving away a few chances. South Africa will be ruing their luck that none of the edges have carried but the only thing they can do is remain positive and keep bowling well. However, the thing that they can change is to bring on the spinners and attack the stumps more often. Stay tuned for the resumption of play after this short break."

Adds that yesterday there was some moisture due to the rain and that helped the bowlers. Gavaskar thinks that with the second new ball in hand now, they should be looking to hit the perfect lines and lengths to trouble the batters. Further suggests that the South African bowlers should be looking to bowl in the area of uncertainty and mix it up with the short ball. The South African bowlers need to tighten up and not bowl loose deliveries."

Rahane is with his skipper at the crease and both have combined for an unbeaten 75-run stand. India will be looking to continue their strong performance on Day 2 and as stated by Mayank Agarwal yesterday, they will be looking to post a total around the 500-run mark.

Just like his last wicket, the skipper of South Africa, Faf du Plessis at first slip takes a good catch. Mayank Agarwal walks off the pitch to a standing ovation from the crowd and the players. A great knock by him comes to an end."

The ball goes behind to long off and the batsmen take a single."

It looked like India would end the session without any casualty but just about 10 minutes before the break Rabada found a way to get past Pujara. It was a tough session for the visitors but towards the end it looked like they found their energy back which was lacking prior. With one new batsman at the crease, South Africa will be looking to build on it and get on top in this Test. The question is can they? Join us after the break for the final session of the first day."

He tries to defend it but the ball goes off the outside edge low towards the left of first slip. Faf du Plessis, the South African skipper there makes no mistake there as he takes a very difficult catch. He is down on the ground after taking the catch almost in relief. A very important breakthrough for the Proteas as they break the 138-run stand."

There is a chance for the third but Pujara is not interested with Agarwal halfway down the track. However, the throw is at the keeper's end and that allows Agarwal to get back in as de Kock has a shy at the bowler's end. The bowler fails to collect the ball and the ball rolls towards mid on. Now Pujara wants a run but Mayank refuses. These two need to sort things out in their running."

However, chances came and went but they could not find a breakthrough until Rabada out of nowhere got a wicket to his name dismissing Rohit Sharma. That would have come as a huge relief to the visitors as he attacked them throughout the Test match in Vizag. However, there was no let up from the other end as Mayank after a shaky start settled down and started to express himself. Pujara also has got in now and they will be eyeing to continue the good work in the second session."

Taking 20 wickets in India is their main task which they were unable to do in the last match. A Test debut for any player is special and states that Anrich Nortje will be happier playing on this pitch as compared to the one in Vizag."

Their 109-run stand might not seem too much of a difference maker but the duo spent more than 3 hours out in the middle. In the process Maharaj got to his maiden Test fifty.

Ashwin gets his 4th wicket of the innings and India will be mightily pleased to know that this innings has ended today itself. Ashwin floats this one on the middle pole line, it pitches and straightens but not enough to meet Rabada's blade as he plays outside the line. The ball hits him on the pad, India appeal and the umpire raises his finger. Rabada straightaway goes for the review knowing he is the last man at the crease. Replays roll in, Ultra Edge shows no bat involved. Ball Tracker comes into play and shows the ball to be hitting the leg pole. This is the 50th Test wicket for Ravichandran Ashwin against South Africa. That will be the last ball of the day as the umpire takes the bails off. STUMPS, DAY 3!"

Ashwin bowls a floated one on the pads, Maharaj looks to flick it down the leg side. He connects but does so uppishly. The leg slip fielder is perfectly positioned and takes the catch there. Rohit Sharma takes a dolly and he is getting hugs from all his teammates. A brilliant, gritty and fighting knock from Keshav Maharaj comes to an end."

They have formed a 82-run stand and India will now be thinking that they might have to bowl on Day 4 as well. With this pair going strong and Rabada still to come, South Africa have turned the match on its head."

Muthusamy gets his front foot out and looks to pad it away. Jadeja and the Indian players put in a stifled appeal. The ball goes behind and it looks like the umpire has turned it down but then the umpire raises his finger. Muthusamy has a word with Faf du Plessis and then refers it upstairs. Replay rolls in and shows the impact was outside but as Senuran was not offering any shot that is not an issue. The Ball Tracker then shows the ball was going onto hit the stumps. Muthusamy has to walk back to the pavilion for the first time as this is his first dismissal in the series. Replays later on show Jadeja was not even appealing. He had his hand on his head and was surprised and delighted when the umpire had raised his finger. South Africa lose one of their two reviews."

It just about clips the bails of the off pole and the ball is gathered by Saha behind the stumps. De Kock is confused about what happened. His skipper asks him from the other end whether he nicked it to which de Kock denies. De Kock then asks one of the Indian players and he replies that de Kock has been bowled. He looks at the giant screen and then starts walking back to the pavilion. South Africa 6 down now and du Plessis looks like the lone warrior now."

Theunis looks to punch it on the up but the ball takes a thick outside edge and goes to the right of Saha. He dives on that side and takes a superb catch. India are all over South Africa.

Sunil thinks there is no devil in the pitch and South Africa need to fight the devil that is just in their head. Kartik tells the texture of the surface is hard. Sunil then adds that the spinner will come into play but tells it is not a crumbly wicket and it is still good to bat on. Kartik adds that there is grass on the middle of the pitch which will help the pacer and some of the balls from there have kept low. He asks Gavaskar on how should one face such deliveries, Gavaskar jokes and says that the batsman can just pray."

On batting with Kohli, Rahane says they enjoy each other's company and they knew they were one batsman short and needed to build a partnership. On the conditions, Rahane says it is better than Vizag as it was very hot and humid there. On whether the game will be spin dominated, Rahane tells it is hot and there is moisture in the wicket, so the pacers can exploit that. As far as spin is concerned, Jinx says the ball is turning and  feels Ashwin and Jadeja are world-class bowlers, calling them dangerous on every wicket."

The star of the day was King Virat Kohli who scored a double ton and formed century stands with Rahane and Jadeja respectively. Rahane scored a half ton and so did Jadeja, but one must say that had Jadeja been a bit selfish, he would have got to his ton as well. He fell for 91 trying to hit quick runs for his side. Kohli was unbeaten at the other end and declared the innings as soon as Jadeja departed with Kohli scoring 254 runs. South Africa were toothless in their bowling and not one bowler stood out. Rabada took 3 wickets while Maharaj and Muthusamy had one each. They leaked runs however and the wickets that fell were too late."

Talking about his seventh double ton, Kohli says that captaincy responsibility has helped him. Adds that he does not plan to go and score a double century but goes in with the mindset of playing five sessions for the team and score runs. On his muted celebrations after reaching the milestone, Kohli says that he has matured over the years which is a natural process. Adds that he is in a phase of his career where things like scoring centuries or double centuries does not matter much to him. Points out that helping the team win is more important. On his stand with Rahane, when Rabada was bowling well on Day 2 morning, Kohli says that he enjoys batting with Rahane. Points out that both of them love to play against top-class bowlers and score runs for the side. Adds that they both help each other whenever they are out in the middle. Talking about the catching in the slip cordon, Kohli points that they have planned well and everyone is doing well. Mentions Saha for his superb keeping and adds that even Ashwin came back into the side well. On the unassailable lead in the series, Kohli says that the series win is okay but mentions that since all these games are part of the ICC Test Championship, hence they will not take the foot off the gas."

Congratulates Kohli for his superb double ton and points out that the side got tired up because of tough two days. Adds that the team needs to be on top of the game but they weren't and hence the defeat. Talking further on Kohli's century, Faf says that Kohli was too good in the entire innings. Says that Virat looked determined and he was hungry for runs. On his three pacer combination, Faf believes the selection was a right call but admits that apart from Philander and to some extent Rabada, none of the bowlers bowled well. Points out that the Indian seamers have done well and they never look out of form. Mentions that he can't blame debutant Nortje for this game. On Ngidi, Faf says that he is fine and working well on his fitness but on these conditions he needs to be completely fit to bowl longer spells."

Points that he has a mindset that whenever he gets an opportunity, he is ready to do well.

India would surely don't want to come back on Day 5 and would look to finish it off in the final session of the day itself. Can they do it? Join us after the break to find out."

Temba Bavuma showed some fight but fell before his fifty. Muthusamy irritated the Indian bowlers before throwing in the towel. Keshav Maharaj and Vernon Philander then once again joined hands just like the first innings and ensured they head into Tea with still 3 wickets to spare."

However, they faced problems in removing the tail in the first innings as well when Philander and Maharaj presented spirited fight. Can the lower order of the visitors present similar resistance? Let's see what happens. Vernon Philander to walk out to bat after the break."

Luck too went India's way as Ball Tracker later on showed that the ball was missing the stumps. That wicket though set the pretext of the session. Theunis de Bruyn stayed for a while before a stunning catch from Saha saw his back. Elgar and Faf du Plessis then tried to grind it out in the middle. The duo added a 49-run stand before the skipper was sent back after another fine catch from Saha. Elgar was fighting a lone battle but a rush of blood moment saw him throw his wicket away."

Saha there fumbles a bit but does well to keep the ball in the air, once, twice, thrice and then in the fourth attempt he gobbles it diving forward. Excellent work from Saha and he continues to prove why Kohli terms him as the best keeper of the country. Just 5 runs off 54 balls for the Protea skipper. His long vigil ends and the situation for South Africa worsen further. 10 minutes to go for Lunch. Can India strike one more time?"

Here comes the Ball Tracker, the impact is umpire's call and hence it doesn't matter even if the ball is hitting the timbers. An excellent review from the Indians because that was marginal.

Markram was unlucky as the replays revealed that had he opted for the review, he would've survived but that was not to be. Skipper Faf du Plessis walked in at number 4 and has seen off the first hour along with Elgar who has got a few streaky boundaries but would love to continue bat as long as he can. India's plans would be simple. Keep chipping in with wickets and do not allow the partnership to get bigger. Interesting hour ahead."

He was bowling in and around off and then he surprises Theunis with a one down the leg side. He tried it in the last over but that was way down, this one is closer to the body. De Bruyn looks to flick but the ball kisses his bat and goes to the left of the keeper. Saha dives to that side and takes a one-handed stunner. If you were wondering why Saha was picked over Pant, then this catch is the reason. He is hailed as one of the best keepers in the world and this is a proof of it. South Africa in all sorts of trouble. 2 down in the 6th over of the day."

A direct hit and Theunis would've been walking into the pavilion."

The Indian players go up in a huge appeal and the umpire raises his finger. Markram has a word with his partner, Elgar. Dean does not look sure and just when Markram was about to review the timer gets to zero. Markram's first pair in Tests. Ishant gets his first wicket of the game. Well hold on, Ball Tracker later on rolls in and it is a disappointing news for Markram, Elgar and the whole of South Africa. The Ball Tracker shows the ball was going onto miss the stumps."
