Abid Ali along with skipper Azhar added 50-pus and consolidated the innings. However, with rain and bad light interruptions, they lost the plot and lost a few quick wickets. Babar and Rizwan then added useful runs before rain cut short Day 1. On Day 2, the rain didn't allow the timely start of Day 2. When we finally got some action, Babar and Rizwan calmly went through that phase to give Pakistan a hint of advantage. England couldn't make the batters play in the curtailed first session."

Just 13 runs for Pakistan but what an incredible recovery it has been from Pakistan to post the kind of total they have. All credit to Rizwan for hanging in with the tail-enders for these important runs. The condition was never easy for batting as it was overcast on Day 1 and Day 2. Pakistan started poorly, recovered, batted poorly again but England failed to deliver a final punch and it allowed Pakistan to recover once again to post a decent first innings score."

With 1 wicket still to go, Rizwan will look to tonk a few more out of the park to take Pakistan further. England will look to get rid of the last wicket quickly to close the innings. And again, for all these things and any sort of action to happen, we will need support from weather god. As per the forecast, they are not too happy and will look to play a spoilsport on Day 3 as well. Anyway, all we can do is hope for a better day. Join us at 1100 local (1000 GMT) on 15th August 2020 for all the action on Day 3. Until then, take care and stay fit."

That didn't do any good as the duo added vital 39 runs. Light deteriorated and we went off. We returned for the final session where only 9 balls were bowled but Broad got the wicket of Abbas. And we went off and just waited and waited, only to get disappointed because the light never got better."

A fuller one around off, Abbas looks to keep it out but misses to get hit on the pads. They appeal and the umpire raises his finger. Abbas goes to his partner and signals the 'T', probably just for the sake of it. Time for the replays. Clearly no bat, says the third umpire. It is hitting the wickets as well, so the DRS doesn't save Abbas. A vital stand for Pakistan but a frustrating one for England comes to an end."

Very good use of the technology and the third umpire must be credited for this decision. The on-field call is overturned. Full ball on off and middle and coming in to the southpaw. Shaheen looks to defend but gets a thick outside edge low to first slip. Root takes it but he is not sure whether it is carried or not. The on-field umpires get together and send it upstairs with the soft signal as NOT OUT! Replay rolls in and it shows that the ball carried to Root but he did not take it cleanly as the ball hit the turf after hitting the England skipper's palm."

Bowls it just behind good length and makes it move away as it gets closer to the bat. Babar is a bit squared up as he looks to defend. An outside edge is induced and the ball goes behind. A straightforward take for Buttler. Babar thought to review it for a second but took the long walk back eventually. A solid knock from Babar but he needed to stay for Pakistan."

England made a fine comeback after Pakistan's good effort in the 1st session. With 5 wickets in hand which includes the presence of Babar Azam, Pakistan will look to put a respectable total while England will be eager to knock the five wickets as quickly as they could. However, for any action to resume, the weather needs to be clear and the current scenario is not too promising as the covers are firmly on the wicket as it is RAINING right now. It can be one of those days where we'll have to sit tight and WAIT. Stay with us."

But let's trust the English weather and see if it does any favor for us, fans and we get more action than Day 1. Pakistan will hope for good innings from Babar and Rizwan while England will hope the bowlers knock the remaining 5 wickets quickly. The action on Day 2 starts at 1100 local (1000 GMT). We will love your company for the same. Until then, take care!"

Abid Ali and skipper Azhar Ali then added 50+ in the first session which was cut short early due to the rain. Players returned for the 2nd session with Pakistan losing skipper Azhar to Anderson. Rain arrived again and washed the remaining 2nd session. We got some action in the final session with Pakistan losing 3 wickets to 3 different bowlers. Abid got out after getting to his half ton to Curran while Asad and Fawad fell to Broad and Woakes respectively. The start-stop didn't help the batters."

He will be gutted with it and all his fans back in Pakistan will also be feeling disheartened. Good length ball pitching on leg, Fawad with his unorthodox stand looks to defend it but the ball comes a bit slower and he misses his defense. He misses and gets hit on the back pad. The England players appeal but the umpire turns it down. Root thinks about it and then decides to signal the 'T'. Replay rolls in and Ultra Edge first confirms no involvement of bat. Time for the Ball Tracker and it shows the pitching is in line of leg stump, the impact is in line and the wicket is hitting the top of middle. No heroic return for Alam and Woakes gets his first of the game. Half the side back in the hut for Pakistan and they are in a spot of bother here."

A fuller ball around off, Abid looks to defend but the ball takes a thick outside edge and goes to third man. He removes his helmet and raises his bat. Fighting innings from him and he has done well to utilize the couple of chances that England failed to take."

A lot of talks before the start of this game about Anderson's position but Jimmy doing what he has done throughout his career, silencing critics with the cherry in hand and wickets in the pocket. Anderson and England have been slightly shorter than they should be but Jimmy corrects it and bowls it full around off. Azhar Ali looks to defend it away from his body but the ball shapes away from him and takes the outside edge. It goes low to the right of second slip and Rory Burns this time makes no mistake and takes a good low catch. Azhar Ali's fighting innings comes to an end. Another failure to get a big score for the Pakistan skipper and the pressure on him will continue to mount. The 72-run stand is broken and England have their first success of the session."

Pakistan had the game under their control for the majority of the time but faltered when it mattered the most. However, they will like to forget that and begin afresh in this game. Will they make any changes? Who will replace Stokes in the English side? All these questions will be answered shortly after the toss. Don't go away!"

On having pink ball for Tests, Root says that there is a time and place for pink ball and says is not sure of using it in between of a Test match. Suggests that maybe a different shade of red ball could be useful. Tells everyone in the squad is fit and is hay to have a lot of choice to chose from. Tells the last game is a huge one as he wants to finish the summer on a high and end the series as 2-0."

The Pakistan players appeal and the umpire raises his finger. Pope looks in doubt but decides to take the review. Replays roll in and Ultra Edge shows that the ball hit the pad before his bat. Time for the Ball Tracker and it shows three reds. Pope has to walk back and he takes away a review with him."

Sibley looks to flick, it goes off a faint edge to Rizwan. An appeal and up goes the finger. Sibley walks back after getting off to another start. We would have termed it as an unlucky mode of dismissal but time and again, Sibley tends to be dismissed like that so it is surely an issue he needs to look into."
