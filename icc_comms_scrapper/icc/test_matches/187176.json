Another one which in the end can be said will be shared. However, one can argue, Australia at the moment do hold the edge. They had the perfect start to this session as they got rid of Denly early. Then Burns followed. Buttler and Stokes did not last for long too. Just as it seemed another English collapse is on the cards, Woakes and Bairstow stepped up. The two played positively and have now taken England to safer shores. They have added 63 and are not yet done. England will hope the two keep going."

Smith floats this one outside off, the ball pitches and straightens. Bairstow offers the leave and it hits his pad along the way to the keeper. Smith is not entirely convinced but Paine still takes the review and it is lost as the ball is missing the off pole by a big margin. Australia have lost both their reviews now and they will be hoping they do not live to regret it."

It goes to the left of short leg where CB dives to his left and seems to have taken it. The Aussies are celebrating but Burns holds his ground. The umpire takes it upstairs. Soft signal is OUT! Replays roll in and they show that the ball did pop out but Bancroft keeps his eyes on the ball and takes it on the second attempt. A good innings by Burns comes to an end but now Australia have both the set batters back in the hut. They are right back in this now."

It goes off the outside edge to the left and low of Paine. He dives and goes for it with one hand but fails to hang on. Maybe he felt it would not have carried so Paine did not give his 100 percent. Just did not seem right as he was going down there. Never looked like taking it."

A much-needed wicket for the visitors as this partnership was really going nicely. End of the 66-run stand though. Early wicket for Australia after the break. Also, replays show later on that Denly did not have a good stride forward, maybe he was worried about the short ball which he was quite uncomfortable against."

The start though belonged to Australia as the returning pacer, Josh Hazlewood ran riot and took two important wickets of Jason Roy and the skipper, Joe Root. But as the game went on, the pitch played out well for the batters as the movement reduced and batting became easier. Joe Denly and Rory Burns steadied the ship as they are amidst a 50-run partnership. The opener is making most of the life he got, having been dropped on 11 by Usman Khawaja. The two batsmen will be eager to make use of the starts they have got. Also, England would hope they can stitch a big stand here. Australia on the other hand, will look to pick a few wickets quickly after the break. Stay tuned for the second session."

An appeal but the umpire shakes his head. Paine and Hazlewood have a chat but don't review. Actually, replays late on show there was no inside edge and it hit him high on the back pad. Also, it was right from Australia to not review as Hawk Eye shows it to be going over."

Coming to the game, well, Australia's morning thus far. They won the toss on a bright and sunny day but the conditions are a mix and match of overcast and sunny. The bowling has been almost perfect with not too many loose deliveries and the hosts have lost two quick wickets. Burns has been impressive with his technique again while Denly has just arrived. Might be lucky that Hazlewood might not carry on for long."

He has kept bowling tight, maidens after maidens and also getting the ball to move both ways. This time he gets it to come back in sharply from outside off. Root fails to put bat on ball and gets hit on the pads. An appeal and the finger goes up. Root has a chat with Burns but his partner feels it is not worth the review and he walks back. Replays later on show, that good he did not review as Hawk Eye shows three reds. Australia's decision to bowl first is proving to be the right one here. Till now that is. England in trouble here."

Would have been his third successive ton this series and also the fourth in the Ashes. Would have been the first player ever to do so. Woakes has done the trick. A length ball, outside off, the former skipper gets across but then shoulders arms. Big, big mistake. A rare moment of indecision from Smudge. He is hit on the pads and immediately starts to walks off even before umpire Gaffaney raises his finger. However, Cummins calls him back and asks him to go for the review. Smith's reaction is like, 'Oh, come on, mate! But fine.' Signals the 'T'. Hawk Eye comes in and shows it to be hitting the stumps. End of another knock which has probably saved the day and match for the Aussies. A magnificent 92. Steve Smith departs but only after a standing ovation from the home of cricket. He came out after getting injured and played bravely. Australia now trail by 24. A one-inning shootout awaits us."

Broad and the whole team are in disbelief as Aleem Dar denies the appeal. The umpire feels that there were two sounds but the replays show that they were of the ball hitting the front and then the back pads. Root gives the 'T' and reviews it straightaway. The Hawk Eye comes in and shows three reds as the ball is crashing into the middle pole. Head is a goner. They have lost 3 quick wickets in the span of 11 runs with the deficit still 187. England are well and truly on top here!"

Jofra bowls this one on a good length outside off. The ball nips back in after pitching and the ball hits the pads of Bancroft, as he shuffles across the stumps in his usual way, attempting to block this one out. However, he does so outside the line and is caught in front of the wickets. Jofra straightaway runs to the keeper in celebration and then appeals. Umpire Aleem Dar does not even wait a second in raising his finger. Cameron is a touch disappointed, looks at the pitch for a while and then towards Khawaja. He feels it might be too high and after some discussion, goes for the review. Hawk Eye shows that the ball has pitched outside off, impact is in line and the ball is clipping the bails of the leg and middle poles. Bancroft might consider himself unlucky here. He fought a battle out there, staying out there for so long and this was one such decision which could have gone either way. England get the breakthrough that they dearly needed and Australia lose their first wicket of the day. The deficit is 198."

For the Men Down Under, it was a good day of bowling as Hazlewood, Cummins and Lyon took three wickets apiece, and Siddle took one. The fielding department was a mixed bag for Aussies as they dropped Burns on 11 and then on 47, but Bancroft made amends by taking a blinder to dismiss him later at short leg."

They think about it and go for the review at the last second. The replays roll in and the Ultra Edge shows that the ball has hit the bat first. Stokes survives. Also, the Hawk Eye comes in later and shows that the ball pitched outside leg. Had it not hit the bat of Stokes, he was still safe. Australia lose one of their reviews."

His availability for the Leeds Test now could be doubtful as players cannot participate in training for at least 6 days."

He kept reminding us of the fiery Caribbean pace of the 70s and 80s, hitting the Aussies hard and making them hop around like rabbits.

Anyways, it is an unlucky dismissal for the Ashes debutant. Full and around middle, Labuschagne looks to play the sweep but he hits it right into the left thigh of Jos Buttler at short leg. The ball lobs towards short mid-wicket where Joe Root dives forward and takes a stunner. England celebrate but Labuschagne is going nowhere. The two umpires have a chat and then refer it to their mate upstairs, with the soft signal as OUT. Here come the replays. From one angle looks like the ball has bounced. From another angle, it looks like the ball has gone into the hands. After a lot of checking, Wilson gives the decision as OUT. Labuschagne shakes his head and mutters some words to Root who says that he caught it cleanly. A sad way to go for the man who played so well. Coach Justin Langer will be remembering something. Flashback to Mumbai 2001. Batsman - Sachin Tendulkar. Bowler - Mark Waugh. Sachin pulls. Ball hits Langer at short leg. Ricochets to short mid-wicket where a certain Ricky Thomas Ponting dives to his right to take the catch. Both the men would be in the Aussie dressing room at the moment. Can comfort the youngster. End of a magnificent 85-run stand."

No consultation there from the bowler it seemed. Ball Tracker arrives and it confirms the impact was outside off."

Khawaja looks to defend it but gets the faintest of outside edges on it. It carries to Jonny Bairstow behind the stumps and he completes the formalities. Now, Jofra barely appeals but someone does and umpire Aleem Dar raises his finger immediately. England are all smiles but Uzzie looks bemused. He is standing there, asking Bancroft something who comes running towards him. They chat about the review and Usman shakes his head to something. Surely, he must be knowing whether he nicked it or not? Now, he turns back and walks. Australia are 2 down (for now) before Tea."

He pitches this one on middle and off on a length, the ball pitches and moves away from Warner. He goes with hard hands at it and gets a thick outside edge which carries to gully where Rory Burns was stationed and he takes it cleanly. Australia again lose Warner cheaply. Well, no Smith first itself. Now, Warner fails to stand up. Could be a tough evening for the Aussies."
