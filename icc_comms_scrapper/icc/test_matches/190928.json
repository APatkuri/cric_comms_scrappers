Join us for the second innings after Tea at 1500 local (0930 GMT)."

India did not start off well losing three wickets early on which would have given South Africa some hope but Rohit and Rahane nullified all that with some excellent batting. They stitched a partnership of 267 before Rahane fell to George Linde. Sharma went on to score his first double ton and in looking to up the ante,but perished. Jadeja and the rest of the batsmen too had their fun in the middle before Kohli finally decided it was time to call in their batsmen."

Rahane brought up his 11th Test ton, fourth at home before becoming the first Test victim of George Linde. What about his Mumbai mate then? Well, he is on fire! Just a run away from his maiden double ton. He wanted to get to that mark before Lunch and hence there were a couple of chances where one could feel he looked nervous but the Hitman has the luck as well. He got Jadeja for company after the fall of Rahane and has added a quick 50-run stand with him to keep the momentum going and piling on the misery for the Protea bowlers."

There is no stopping Rohit Sharma. He has raked up a magnificent Test ton, his third of the series and is looking like a beast at the moment. Rahane who joined him when the side was in trouble has played a top knock as well in the 166-run stand. The South African bowlers have nothing to show from this session apart from the hammering they have got from the duo of Rohit and Rahane. How will they respond in the final session of the day? Only time will tell. Join us for the evening session at 1430 local (0900 GMT)."

Here comes the Ball Tracker, and it shows that the ball is clipping the leg stump. Which means Kohli has to walk back. A superb set up from Nortje.

An excellent hour of play for the visitors as they have managed to make use of the new ball and get two early wickets which did not happen in the earlier matches. They would be buoyed by the spell bowled by Rabada who bowled with venom and troubled the Indian batsmen. India, on the other hand, are under pressure for the first time in the series and would want Virat Kohli to score a big knock here. Rohit has looked edgy but has managed to survive."

Rabada and South Africa make a loud appeal but the umpire, surprisingly, says not out. Rabada signals for the DRS straightaway. The skipper obliges and gets the decision overturned as the Ultra Edge shows no bat and the Ball Tracker shows three reds, hitting the middle stump. Pujara has to depart. A successful review from South Africa. A perfect start for the Proteas in this Test after losing the toss."

Let's see how long they can hold on. Will Kohli enforce the follow-on if he manages to get the remaining two wickets quickly? Or will the frustration for the Indians continue? Interesting second half of the second session coming up. The floodlights have taken effect at the stadium. Shahbaz Nadeem will bowl for the hosts."

Umesh recovers, gets to the ball and fires a throws  at the non-striker's end. Direct hit it is, Rabada has to depart. He looks at the heavens as he walks back to the pavilion. The umpire does not even go to the third umpire to check as Kagiso was well out. Excellent piece of fielding."

Adds that the partnership between the two was very important. On being asked about his cover drives, Rahane points out that his flick between mid-wicket and mid on is his favorite shot. On Rohit opening, he answers that he is very happy for Rohit Sharma as he has taken the opportunity with both hands. On the pitch, Jinx says that the ball kept low early on. Points that if the bowlers can bowl wicket-to-wicket, things won't be easy for the batters. Talking about the two wickets the Indians got, Rahane says that it was amazing to see the pacers get wickets on bouncers."

With contributions from Pujara, Rahane and Jadeja, India yet again posted a huge total of 601 runs before the declaration. And then the Indian bowlers took the responsibility upon them and once again bundled the South Africans for 275 runs which could've been lot less if not for the 109-run stand between Maharaj and Philander for the 9th wicket. Indian skipper Kohli enforced the follow-on there too and the bowlers this time combined together to bundle the visitors out for 189 runs and winning the game by an innings and 137 runs.

Day 3 started with Umesh Yadav removing the visitors' skipper Faf du Plessis in the first over. Then, a 91-run stand was the only positive that happened for the Proteas in the first innings. Hamza after getting to his maiden half ton departed and the visitors were bundled for a paltry total of 162 runs. Umesh Yadav was the pick of the bowlers with 3 scalps while Shami, Jadeja and debutant Nadeem picked two apiece. Kohli then enforced the follow-on, 8th time as a captain, most by an Indian."

Well, no luck as Kohli won the toss and opted to bat first. The decision looked to backfire when Rabada struck twice to leave India reeling at 39/3. And then two Mumbai lads got together and stitched a mammoth 267-run stand between them. Rohit Sharma went on to score his maiden double ton while Rahane got to a century at home after 3 years. Ravindra Jadeja scored a half ton too but Umesh Yadav's 5 sixes in 10 balls added insult to injury for the Proteas and helped India post 497 runs before Virat declared the innings."

The Indian players appeal and Nigel Llong gives it out immediately. Klaasen consults his partner regarding the review and decides not to take the review. Good decision in the end as the Ball Tracker shows that it was going on to hit the leg stump."

Faf looks to defend it out but is beaten as the ball jags back in. It hits the pads, Shami and the Indians belt out an appeal. The umpire agrees. The Protea skipper consults Elgar and goes for the DRS. Well, keep walking, Mr. Skipper because there is no edge and three reds it is which is confirmed by the Ultra Edge and the Ball Tracker. Skipper gone, takes one review with him too. South Africa in tatters, in the second innings too."
