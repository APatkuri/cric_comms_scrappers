Kusal has completely misread that one and that has outdone him. Boult steams in and bowls it on a length on off. Kusal expects it to move away and hence he shoulders arms to this one. The ball though comes in and hits the back leg of Perera. New Zealand players put in a huge appeal and the umpire agrees. Perera and Dimuth have a discussion and they opt against the review. Good decision as that looked plumb to the naked eye. Hawk Eye shows that Kusal Perera would have had to continue his walk as the ball was going onto clip the stumps. But one cannot leave such ball on a sub-continental wicket as the ball does not bounce here as much as other countries.,True,11757,,
