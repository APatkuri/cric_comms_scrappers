157,199339,1,25.4,177,0,,W,True,63755,Jasprit Bumrah,65548,Dan Lawrence,R,OUT! LBW! As plumb as it gets! Bumrah strikes for the first time in his Test career in India. This is a typical Bumrah delivery. Credit to Kohli as well. He has done his homework. Lawrence is a good player of spin and he easily could have continued with Ashwin after the spinner got a wicket but he introduced Bumrah and his strike bowler gives him the breakthrough. Fuller delivery pitching around off and jagging back in at pace. Lawrence looks to flick but is too late to get his bat down and the ball hits him on the backpad. Bumrah knows he has his man but puts in the mandatory appeal. The umpire has no qualms in raising the finger. Lawrence has a word with Sibley but he gets no support from him for the review. Good call because it looked plumb and the Ball Tracker later on proves it.,2021-02-06T03:12:11+00:00,63621,Dom Sibley,63/2,0,0,True,65548,,lbw,lbw,,
