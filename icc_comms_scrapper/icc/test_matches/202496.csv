And that immediately paid dividends. This was a full ball outside off and normally, Smith would walk across and nudge it to the on side. But that leg slip planted a seed of doubt in his mind. He played rather loosely, well away from his body and the result was a yawning gap between bat and pad. The ball went through that gap, took the inside edge and hit the stumps.
