The hosts though would have loved to reach the 500-run mark but the acceleration did not quite go as they planned. They kept losing wickets at regular intervals but 469 is still a big score and it is basically because of the contributions of the two batters, Sibley who scored his second ton and Stokes who scored his 10th Test ton. The two added over 250, they took their own time and now have England in a very promising position. Nobody except for the two contributed a lot. Buttler did get off to a start. Bess played a decent cameo towards the end but it was Stokes and Sibley's partnership which was the highlight."

Stokes looks to play the reverse sweep but the ball kisses the glove and goes to the keeper. An appeal and up goes the finger. End of a superb innings from Stokes.

The hosts are completely in command of this game and are cruising at this stage. The hosts have piled on runs and unlike the previous sessions Ben Stokes has changed gears as the hosts have scored 114 runs in this session. West Indies did manage to get 2 wickets, that of Sibley and Pope but the English all-rounder is looking comfortable and going about his business like his usual aggressive self. He is unbeaten on 172 and partnered by Jos Buttler. It will be interesting to see what Root and co decide to do in the final session as rain is expected to spoil Day 3. The tourists, on the other hand, would look to strike early in the final session and if asked to bat today would like to start with some momentum. What do we have in store in the final session? Join us at 1615 local (1515 GMT) to find out."

Replay rolls in and after a few views and angles the umpire decides that Gabriel's front foot is fine. Time for the Ultra Edge which shows no bat. Ball Tracker then comes on and it shows the Pitching is in line, the Impact is line but the ball is going to miss the stumps.

West Indies players appeal but the umpire does not agree. Holder thinks and has a word with his teammates and then decides to signal the 'T'. The front foot is fine first up. Time for Ultra Edge and it shows no spike as the ball goes past the bat. Time for the Ball Tracker and it shows the Pitching is red. The Imapact is red but the Wicket is hitting on umpire's call."

It has been a calm, patient and an old school Test match innings from him but one which has been very valuable. Excellent composure shown by him and it has taken him 312 deliveries to reach his milestone. Full ball on off, Sibley drives it through mid off and gets three to reach to his second Test ton. 5th slowest century for England in Tests since 1990. Sibley hugs Stokes and it has been a fine knock. Unfortunately it is in a closed stadium but all the English fans would have enjoyed every part of it sitting at home."

Sibley has been patient and will look to continue to keep his calm and composure and do the same. Stokes too played a very disciplined innings and showed his maturity. The pair have added 126 runs and would look to build on it. West Indies, on the other hand, will not be disheartened as they haven't leaked a lot of runs and can begin the day with the new ball. The tourists would look to put on a better show with the second new ball and look to strike early and end this stand. What do we have in store on Day 2?"

To add to that, their star from the first Test, Gabriel, did not seem to be at his best and was struggling with fitness. Despite all of that though, the Windies would know a couple of quick wickets on Day 2 and they are right back in this. However, another good partnership will see them fall well behind in the game. An important first session awaits. Do join us at 1100 local (1000 GMT). Till then, take care and goodbye!"

Good length delivery pitching outside off and jagging back in. Sibley looks to flick but misses and gets hit high on his pad. The West Indies player put in a hug appeal but the umpire is unmoved. Roach is confident and Holder goes with his bowler's instinct. Relay rolls in and Ultra Edge shows that there is no bat involved. Time for the Ball Tracker and it shows the Pitching is red, the Impact is red but the wicket is hitting on umpire's call. Sibley survives."

England were straightaway on the back foot as they lost Crawley in the first ball of the session but Root and Sibley solidified the innings with a -run stand before the skipper departed. Sibley though has been going along nicely and has had no problem in leaving and defending deliveries. Stokes too has been cautious in his approach and the pair have added 31 so far. West Indies will be happy with their effort as they managed  to pick two wickets and have kept the run check at bay. A shared session is what one can say and this Test match has been nicely poised on the first day so far. It started to go dark towards the end of the session but let's hope we get full final session without any interruption. Who will finish Day 1 on the front foot? Join us at 1645 local (1545 GMT) for the final session to find out."

The West Indies players put in a huge appeal and the umpire raises his finger. Burns has a brief chat with Sibley and then decides to take it upstairs. Replay rolls in and first it is confirmed no bat is involved. Time for Ball Tracker and it shows all reds. Burns has to walk back and he takes away a review as well.

States that they are positive for this game and they are looking forward to it. Adds that it is a good wicket to bat on and they will look to give in good performances."

After being humbled in the first Test by the visitors, the hosts received a boost in the form of Joe Root, who has returned to the squad and they will expect that he leads his team to a victory and level the series. But, they have been dealt a big blow with Jofra Archer being ruled out of the Test as he breached the bio-secure protocols. He will be spending 5 days in quarantine and will undergo 2 Covid-19 tests before he can rejoin the squad. This is a big blow as he was England's best bowler in the first Test. Who will replace him? That question will be an interesting one to keep an eye on.  They need their batting to pull their socks up and stick it out in the middle. West Indies, on the other hand, have plenty to be pleased about. They won the first match comfortably and will be looking to repeat the performance and win the series with one game to spare. Hello and welcome to the second Test between England and West Indies."

The post Lunch session did not begin the way they would have wanted as they lost Hope early but Brooks joined Brathwaite in the fight and the pair added 76 before the opener was dismissed against the run of play for 75. Brooks though has continued his battle and is looking impressive on 60. England needed more than the 2 wickets but have found it difficult. The bowlers have put in a lot of effort though but to little success. The new ball is not far away and the hosts would like to make the most of it in the final session and try to bowl the tourists out. A very decisive session awaits us as we find out which way this Test is headed. Join us for the last session of Day 4 to find out."

Good length ball just outside off, Hope gets on his front foot and looks to defend but the ball straightens and kisses the outside edge of the bat and goes straight to Jos Buttler behind the stumps. He takes an easy catch and the budding stand is broken."

Their first goal will be to avoid the follow-on and then get as close as possible to the hosts' total. The first session can indicate to which way this game is going. The weather is all clear here in Manchester and we can't wait for the game to begin. Welcome to the coverage of Day 4. Stay tuned...."

They batted most of the day, ensured that the Windies toiled for more than two sessions as they put a mammoth score and then have also managed to send one of the openers packing. They would have obviously loved another, they could have got another had they reviewed on the second last ball of the day but they will be happy with their overall work. More of the same is what Root will be hoping for on Day 3. West Indies, on the other hand, would hope their batters to deliver, partnerships is what they need and they will be eager to get close to if not surpass the English total. However, what the visitors won't mind too is some rain. The forecast is not good for Day 3, England though would hope the rain gods have mercy on them and stay away. Do join us for all the action at 1100 local (1000 GMT)."

Curran appeals feeling it brushed the pad first but the umpire shakes his head. England do not review but... replays just show that it brushed the pad first. Maybe if it had been a top order player, they would have probably gone for it but since it was Joseph, they might have decided against. All Curran can do now is smile."

Just 4 balls into his first over and he gets rid of one opener. Excellent review too! Curran bowls it full and around off, it shapes in a touch. He got this one to come in after taking the last two away. Campbell looks to drive but there are two noises. It has hit the pad for sure but is it bat-pad or pad and pad? England appeal and the umpire feels its the former and shakes his head. England review. Replays show it is front pad and back pad. Time for the Hawk Eye and it shows the on-field call has to be overturned. Another low score for Campbell, England would like one more before Stumps."

However, once England took the second new ball, West Indies lost their way and somehow managed to avoid the follow-on with Chase helping them do that. Broad and Woakes finished with 3 apiece while Curran got 2 and Stokes and Bess took 1 wicket."

They started well with a couple of wickets early on but Sibley and Stokes combined for a marathon stand and took England towards a huge total. Both brought up their respective tons. They eventually declared on 469/9. Discussions were going around regarding the approach of Sibley and Stokes during that partnership knowing the fact that there were chances of rain on Day 3. For the Windies bowlers, it was a long toil that lasted for nearly 2 days with Chase taking a fifer. As per the forecast, the entire day's play on Day 3 was washed out."

The change of angle works as the ball comes in off the deck. Brooks looks to defend off his back foot but misses and gets stuck on the crease. The ball hits him on his back pad. The English players put in a huge appeal and the umpire raises his finger. Brooks has a word with Holder but opts against review.

A good length ball around off, Dowrich after facing the chin music in the last over is hoping to work it on the leg side. He moves a little towards the off side and is hit on the pad. Woakes and others put in a loud appeal and the umpire raises his finger. Dowrich takes it upstairs after having a word with Brooks. Let's see if he is safe or no. Front foot is fine. No bat involved either. Where is it hitting? Clipping the leg stump so the on-field decision stays. Dowrich has to go and England just 4 wickets away from leveling the series."

It looked like West Indies would lose just one wicket but the hard work, effort and commitment of Stokes ensured that they break the 100-run stand right before Tea and head to the break with momentum on their side. It was a fascinating session of cricket as after getting rid of Roston Case early in the session, it looked like the hosts were cruising but Blackwood joined Brooks out in the middle and the pair put up a brilliant fight with both getting to their respective half centuries and adding a 100-run stand. It looked like the duo had done enough and would go to Tea unscathed but right at the stroke of Tea, Blackwood fell prey to Stokes' vicious bouncer and it is England who will feel like they have the momentum. West Indies are still in this with a fighting chance to draw. England, on the other hand, still have a lot to do as Brooks is out there and Dowrich and West Indies' best batter in the side, Holder still to come. So just over 42 overs to be bowled in the final session and 5 wickets in hand we are set for a thrilling finale. Do not miss out on this as it promises to be a great end to this Test. Join us for the final session at 1615 local (1515 GMT) to find out which way this Test goes."

Oh wait, it looks like there was some glove. Lucky, Brooks is a lucky man. A brilliant, effort ball from Woakes. It is short and just around off, Brooks hops and tries to let it go by dropping his hands. However, it takes the gloves and goes behind but none of the English players were sure so they do not opt for the review."

The tourists have looked lackluster with the willow and are in a troublesome position. They would look to improve and have a much better second session. Can the tourists put on a fight or will England have a fruitful second session as well? Join us at 1340 Local (1240 GMT) to find out."

An aggressive innings from Stokes gave the hosts a lead in excess of 300 and after declaring with the lead of 311, the hosts would have looked for a couple of wickets from their new ball bowlers. That is what they got, the returning Broad proved why he shouldn't be dropped as he picked two and his new ball partner Woakes getting one. The hosts are clearly on top of this game."
