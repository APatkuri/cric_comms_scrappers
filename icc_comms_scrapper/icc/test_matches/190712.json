That was the time when they got Matthew Wade last evening but other than that and the Warner catch, it has all been poor shot selection from the Aussies. But Wagner toiled hard, totally deserving his 4 wickets while Southee got some cheap ones towards the end. Sadly for the Kiwis, Santner was unimpressive and they did miss Lockie Ferguson today."

After spending 145 overs in the field, you do this. Rephrase. EVEN after spending so much time on the field, you do this. Full and outside off, angling away, Starc looks to go over the bowler but the bat turns in his hands and he ends up skewing it. The ball goes off the top edge high in the air. It looks like it will land safely but Williamson covers good ground to his right from mid off, keeps his eyes on the ball and then slides to take a stunner. Superb. Starc's cameo ends but the innings doesn't. Australia continue to bat."

A good length ball, coming in sharply. Pat looks to defend but fails to make connection as the ball sneaks through and goes to Watling behind. Watling and the bowler make a loud appeal. Not out says the umpire. Southee and Watling are sure that they heard a noise but Williamson says he did not hear a thing. Replays roll in and they suggest that there was no bat involved and the noise was of the ball kissing the pocket of the trouser."

However, the Aussie overnight batters were up for the challenge as they played them well. Labuschagne eventually fell to Wagner just before the Drinks break. Head is looking solid out there in the middle. He has skipper Paine for company. They would look to add another partnership to take Australia towards a big first innings score. The Kiwis are already one bowler short and it seems like they will be having a tough next hour too. They would love to get a few more wickets as soon as they can and try restricting the Aussies to as low as they could. Hot and humid conditions are surely not gonna help them. Interesting hour ahead."

Sad, sad moment for Marnus Labuschagne. In spite of scoring 143? Why, do you ask? Because Labuschagne would have been only the third player after Zaheer Abbas and Mudassar Nazar to register three consecutive 150-plus scores in Test cricket! He is distraught. Not perhaps of the missed record but simply because he has been denied an opportunity to bat throughout the day. A bit of his own doing, one would say. Labuschagne walks across his stumps and does so pretty early. Wagner targets the stumps and does so with a fast ball. Labuschagne misses his flick and the ball hits the stumps. He just stands there dismayed and then trudges off. The whole crowd gives him a standing applause. Can New Zealand keep Australia under 375 now?"

Steven Smith looked out of sorts but Labuschagne looked like a man in total control. He left the balls well, had good compact defense and also attacked the odd bad ball.

Steven Smith and Marnus Labuschagne then formed a 132-run stand and took the hosts to comfortable shores before Smith departed. However, the day belonged to Marnus Labuschagne who made batting look easy on a very tricky pitch where even Steven Smith struggled to find his rhythm. He will be looking to carry on from his knock of 110 runs on Day 2 and give his team a healthy advantage."

There was some noise as the ball went past the bat. Wonder what it was. Well, you cannot blame Smith on playing that shot. It looked like he was playing well away from his body but the natural angle of Ferguson gets the ball into the right-hander. Which is why Smith looked to play at that. But on this occasion, Lockie got it to move away."

Warner initially hangs around, wanting a confirmation but Wagner claims his catch and the umpires get together.

Kane Williamson's policy to go to his gun bowler, or well dibbly-dobbly, if you like, has paid rich dividends. That is the strength of CdG. People take him lightly and he punches you above his weight. His strength is accuracy and he keeps the balls pretty straight. No different here. Fuller in length, hint of inswing, Burns plays a lazy flick shot and misses it. Cannot do that. However slow the ball might be. Is pinged on the pads flush in front and Colin starts to celebrate, then appeals. Umpire Aleem Dar takes his time but then raises his finger. Burns walks towards his partner, has a discussion about the review but Warner is not too hopeful. Here comes Ball Tracker. MISSING LEG STUMP! Well, well, well. Tim Paine or no Tim Paine, reviews are not Australia's forte. The solid-looking stand is broken."

The third umpire has told Aleem Dar, the onfield umpire that he has no conclusive evidence to overturn the decision. 5-fer for Starc, though it can be argued whether this was a wicket in the first place. Nasty bouncer, bowled around middle and off, de Grandhomme looks to defend it off the back foot but the ball suddenly shoots up. It goes off something to Steven Smith at second slip who pouches it safely to his left. Now, Starc straightaway celebrates and so do the Aussies. However, de Grandhomme looks a bit confused. He asks Aleem Dar who now gives it out. Colin looks bemused and consults his partner for a review. Signals the 'T'. Here come the replays. Now, by the first look, to the naked eye, from the side on angle, it seems like it has kissed the helmet. But has it kissed the glove or the outside edge? Now, Hot Spot shows nothing on the gloves and then the Ultra Edge rolls in. There is a spike. But, AFTER it goes past the gloves. The third umpire takes multiple looks at it and with every look, it seems like it has missed the glove. However, Marais Erasmus does not want to take any risks and tells Dar that he is not sure whether there is any conclusive evidence to overturn the decision. So, the decision stays as it is. Tough, tough luck for Colin. He will feel robbed. And the Kiwis are robbed of a review as well. If the third umpire is not sure, shouldn't the benefit of doubt go to the batsman? Possible thoughts about changing the rule?"

It shows no mark while the ball is close to the gloves. Nothing on the Snicko either. However, the third umpire says that he has 'NO' conclusive evidence to overturn the decision. Pretty bizarre.

Change in bowling too as Starc returns. He is one shy of getting a fifer. In the Drinks break, the broadcaster chats with Smith. Smith says that he was expecting the ball to come towards him in the slips. Tells that there's extra bit of bounce on Perth wicket and hence he always expects the ball to come in the slips. Adds that Lyon was getting a few past the inside and outside edges of Rosco, so the one taking the outside edge was always coming. On his catch late on Day 2, Junior Waugh asks Smith if he is seeing the ball well, Smith points that Waugh himself has taken quite a few catches in the slips in his hay days."

But perhaps, he was consumed by the fact that there was a break round the corner. Taylor lunges forward and looks to defend it towards the off side. The ball goes straight on, takes the outside edge and goes towards Steven Smith at first slip. He bends low and pouches it comfortably, just above the turf. Also, commendable effort from Travis Head on the third ball of this over. Had that been a single, Rosco might still have been batting!"

More fondly remembered as Stokesingley? Nathan Lyon missed a series-winning run out there. But here, not too sure whether he can be blamed totally. Length delivery on off, Taylor taps it towards covers. He takes the single and Watling returns for the second. However, Taylor takes a few steps and then says no. Watling has no option but to go back. Nathan Lyon gets to the ball from backward point, picks the ball and throws it at the keeper's end. BJ is gone for all money but Tim Paine fails to collect the ball and misses a massive chance of a run out there. The reason for the miss of Paine was that in the corner of his left eye, he saw Marnus Labuschagne get to collect the ball from short leg. Hence, he just took his eyes off the ball at the last moment. And hence, the ball bounces hard into his gloves and drops down. Watling comes back in. Costly. Really costly."

A pensive-looking Justin Langer sitting outside the boundary late in the evening on Day 2 signalled some bad and serious news. And this morning, it was confirmed. HAZLEWOOD HAS BEEN RULED OUT OF THE REMAINDER OF THIS TEST, due to a left hamstring strain. He will bat, IF REQUIRED, pretty much like Lockie Ferguson. Which means, Australia just have 3 bowlers to try and take the required 15 wickets. So if you see, the match hangs in the balance."

As we have seen that the first two sessions have been excellent to bat and the Black Caps would feel like batting on a different planet on Saturday. Can they make use of those batting-friendly conditions? Australia, on the other hand, will try and take the remaining wickets as quickly as possible otherwise it could be a very tiring day for their bowlers. A lot to play for and it promises to be an exciting day. Do join us at 1300 local (0500 GMT). Till then, take care and goodbye!"

There was a moment in the play when Williamson had edged one but Australia did not review. It seemed like that opportunity and being one bowler short would cost them big but an inspirational piece of catching by Steven Smith to dismiss Kane opened the floodgates. From then on, the procession started. The Kiwis slipped from 77 for 2 to 97 for 5 and now face an uphill task to get back into the game!"

Wagner is in two minds there and eventually looks to jam it out but does so away from his body. It hits the inside edge and crashes into the stumps. The crowd is going mad. Starc is on fire!

Nicholls looks to flick but the ball kisses the edge and goes to Paine who takes it, appeals and up goes the finger. Henry is disgusted with himself as he walks back. New Zealand in deep trouble now.

Why did Williamson play that? It is a short ball outside off, Williamson looks to guide it down to third man but does not commit to the shot completely. It goes off the outside edge and flies between third slip and second slip. Smith dives horizontally, stretches his right hand out and the ball stays in. A one-handed blinder to get rid of the Kiwi skipper. A special catch to remove a special player. Also, something outstanding to break a stand which looked at ease. Williamson walks back disappointed. Maybe a lapse of concentration for him there. Played at a ball he could have left. Australia back on top now. Kiwis trail by 339 runs."

PC dives to his right and stops it. Seeing that Williamson sends Taylor back who is halfway down the track. Cummins lobs it towards the stumps at the striker's end. He misses but Warner from gully rushes towards the stumps, catches the throw and then underarms it onto the stumps. An appeal and the umpire takes it upstairs.

They would not want their premier bowler to get injured to this short stuff. A length ball, outside leg, Pat looks to tickle but only manages a thin inside. Watling catches and appeals but PC is going nowhere. Now, he looks at the umpire who raises his finger and Cummins is happy to go. Wagner two away from a 5-fer in this innings."

New Zealand found it very difficult on Friday, Australia found it even more on Saturday. That last session yesterday has just quickened this game, which might enable us to have an off on Monday.

However, after that things went haywire for the hosts as their downward spiral started in the last session of the day. They collapsed from 131/1 to 160/6, all within the last hour giving the Kiwis a glimmer of hope when it seemed like they were down and out. However, the Aussies stay still on top with a lead of 417 runs and 4 wickets in hand. If the hosts manage to set a target of around 500, they will be more than happy."

The only players who could come out with some credit for the visitors were Ross Taylor and Kane Williamson who scored 80 and 34 runs respectively. Except for Colin de Grandhomme and these two, no one could even get to the double-digit mark, a rare sight for the Kiwis."

While they have lost the wicket of Warner, Burns along with Labuschagne have added 31 runs in 9 overs. The Kiwis have bowled good lines and lengths but have not been able to get wickets. A dropped catch from de Grandhomme and the run out opportunity missed by Santner, these are two things the Kiwis might talk about in this break. The two reviews that they've lost might trouble them going ahead. Now, how many more Australia would feel safe with? Will they force the Kiwis to bat tonight? Will be interesting to see what approach the Australians come out with. Do join us back for the final session."

There was a distance between bat and pad so there was no chance of there being bat on it. The Ball Tracker then rolls in and it confirms that Marnus was hit on the pocket outside off. The impact won't matter as Marnus left the ball alone but the ball was going on to miss the stumps by a mile. Poor review from Kiwis and they have lost their second review as well."

Now that both Warner and Burns look settled, they would probably look for scoring opportunities while the Kiwis will hope to get a couple of quick wickets. Interesting hour coming up."

It seems like Warner is going off but maybe he was going towards square leg to switch off. Williamson though goes for the review. Let's find out. First up, it is Hot Spot. Nothing conclusive from it. Not the proper angle to view it. Here comes Snicko. No deflection as it goes past the gloves. Then as the ball passes the gloves, it hits the shoulder and there's the deflection of the same on the Snicko. Don't change your decision says Erasmus to Aleem Dar. Warner to continue, the Kiwis go one review down."

Bat quickly or normally, we shall come to know after the break. A good session for the Aussies, piling on the pressure, in spite of losing Hazlewood. Their score now reads 251/0 and they might target 400. Or, a quickfire batting performance to get to 350 by Tea and then declare. Join us back at 3.40 pm local time (0740 GMT). 63 overs left in the day."

With the bat, Ross Taylor's 80 gave them some respectability in the first innings while Watling and de Grandhomme's efforts in the second dig ensured that there was some fight shown. But clearly, they required more. Kane Williamson not performing in both innings hurt them."

His century ensured that New Zealand were on the back foot as Australia got to 416. Then, as one expected, Starc was menacing with the ball under lights and his 5-fer just pushed the Kiwis to the hilt. Once the 250-run lead was taken, there was no doubt who was going to win the game."

A short ball, right at the body from around the wicket, Mitchell cannot do much other than hop and tamely fend at it. The ball goes straight off the face of the bat, straight to silly point who just takes it calmly. Or makes it look pretty simple."

He straightaway ran to the bowler in celebration and then started to appeal. But umpire Nigel Llong, seemingly looking frustrated at the continuous appeals from Australia all day, shook his head. For a change, Paine did not ask anyone. ANYONE. Smith at first slip did not move an inch while Starc was just looking to go back to his mark. Then suddenly, he sees his skipper go for the review and is clearly surprised, asking him whether he was sure! From the replays, to the naked eye, it looks the ball has hit the abdomen. But Hot Spot shows the tiniest of marks on the glove and then the abdomen! Nothing on the Snickometer but that does not matter. The decision is overturned and Watling has to depart. Well played, once again."

A length ball around off, de Grandhomme is forced to play at it but the ball seams away off the deck and takes Colin by surprise. He cannot do much having already committed into the shot. The outside edge is taken and it goes low to first slip where Steven Smith takes it safely, then dives forward. End of a wonderful 56-run stand."

Also, Nathan Lyon comes in running from point. Wade tries to kick the ball onto the stumps at the striker's end with his left foot but cannot quite connect cleanly. De Grandhomme would have been out had that hit! But the fun does not end there. Wade and Lyon almost collide into one another, knocking each other down! Both get up with a smile while umpire Aleem Dar at square leg has a chuckle."

Tossed up delivery outside off, Nicholls lunges to defend but the ball comes in with the angle, hits the pads and lobs to silly point. Now, Travis Head takes it, celebrates and then appeals. Aleem Dar immediately raises his finger. Seeing that, Travis Head runs around in circles in jubilation while Nicholls asks the umpire the manner of his dismissal. On being informed that he has been given out caught, Nicholls has a long chat with Watling and then signals the 'T'. Now comes the bizarre part. From one side of the replays, it seems that the ball has hit the pad, then hit the back of the bat and dipped to Travis Head who has taken a very good catch, inches above the ground. But the third umpire is only checking the legality of the catch. Does that mean he is satisfied there is an edge? No Hot Spot is checked, nor Snicko. Eventually, the third umpire relays the message to Aleem Dar who signals it OUT once again. So - was this an umpire's review or a player's review? Something to ponder as TEA IS TAKEN."

Latham is hit on his back foot and seems to fall over a touch. It looks close to the naked eye but Ball Tracker shows it to be going over the top. Superb decision from Nigel Llong and excellent call from Nathan Lyon at point to tell Paine not to review. He would have been at the best angle to see where the ball would have hit."

Nothing much he could have done there. The pitch has consumed him. Accurate Lyon lands this right on the rough outside off, around a shorter length. Williamson stays back to tuck but the ball lands on that black mark, generates dust and kicks off suddenly. Zooms in, takes the inside edge, hits the thigh and lobs to Matthew Wade at short leg. The Aussies celebrate and even before the appeal can be completed, Aleem Dar's finger is up. They check for the overstepping but Lyon is fine. Williamson walks back disappointed but to be fair, there was nothing much he could have done to that ball."
