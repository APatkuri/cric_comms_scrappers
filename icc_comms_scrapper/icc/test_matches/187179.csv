Curran had been adjudged LBW following an appeal by the Aussies. He had started to walk back as he knew it was plumb. Cummins pitched this on middle and got it to shape back in and Curran missed the ball to get hit in front of the stumps. Umpire Dharmasena gives it out LBW but he wants to check for overstepping. The replays roll in, and YES, Cummins has overstepped. Curran has been given a lifeline by the Aussies after Root was given three. Looks like it is Christmas Down Under.",,,,
