Aleem Dar immediately raises his finger. Seeing that, Travis Head runs around in circles in jubilation while Nicholls asks the umpire the manner of his dismissal. On being informed that he has been given out caught, Nicholls has a long chat with Watling and then signals the 'T'. Now comes the bizarre part. From one side of the replays, it seems that the ball has hit the pad, then hit the back of the bat and dipped to Travis Head who has taken a very good catch, inches above the ground. But the third umpire is only checking the legality of the catch. Does that mean he is satisfied there is an edge? No Hot Spot is checked, nor Snicko. Eventually, the third umpire relays the message to Aleem Dar who signals it OUT once again. So - was this an umpire's review or a player's review? Something to ponder as TEA IS TAKEN.",True,57594,,
