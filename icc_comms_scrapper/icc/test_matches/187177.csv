Another brilliant ball from the Aussie quick. It starts on middle and off and zips away from the batter. Forcing Root to have a poke at it. Root looks to defend but gets a fat outside edge which goes to first slip. Warner once again does a good job and takes a fine catch. For the first time in Test cricket, Joe Root registers back-to-back ducks. The idea of batting the skipper at number 3 has not worked so far.",True,10129,,
