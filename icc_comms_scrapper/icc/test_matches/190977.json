The middle order did not show any resistance and the lower order too failed to do anything substantial today. Just the 43 runs added by India this morning. Rahane was the only man who showed some fight. Pant also was looking good before he got run out. The procession started from there on and India got bundled out for a paltry first innings total."

There is a noise as the ball passes the bat. Watling takes it and then appeals. Dar thinks and then raises his finger. Ishant reviews immediately. Replays roll in and they show the noise was of the ball hitting the back pad. They then check for the LBW too but the impact is outside off. The on-field call has to be overturned. Good review by Sharma."

Pant was looking nice and positive today, he really gave that feeling that he is quite focused and determined to do something special but he falls in the last manner a batter would want to be dismissed. This is a back of a length delivery, Rahane guides it towards point. He takes off, he is charging towards the other end. Pant is not interested as he wants Rahane to go back although after taking a start. Till the time Rahane sees that, he is halfway down the track. He continues running and hence, Pant has to go for it. Ajaz Patel picks the ball up, he knows he has time on his hands, takes aim and hits the stumps. Pant is way short, he never had any chance of making it. Rishabh walks back disappointed and the Kiwis celebrate. Ideal start for them."

The two who will resume their innings today, Pant and Rahane, are amidst a promising stand. India will hope they can continue and take them to a fighting total. The first hour is quite crucial.

At the start of the day, they won the toss and elected to field under overcast conditions on a green wicket. Their bowlers justified the decision as they kept taking wickets at regular intervals and also made scoring very tough for India. Debutant Kyle Jamieson was the pick of the bowlers for them as he took three wickets which included Kohli and Pujara. Rahane though has fought hard out there along with Pant but with not a lot of batting to come, the visitors would be hoping for this pair to maximize the partnership. 250 is what India will be aiming for but they will need to bat really well if they are to get there. Saturday will be a new day! Will we see India make a comeback in the game or will the same script continue? Join us to find out on Day 2."

Pujara first and now Kohli. The Kiwis right on top at the moment. Too early to play that shot to be honest. Especially on a wicket which is providing some assistance to the bowlers. It is slightly fuller in length, not a driving length, just behind it. Outside off and moving away. Kohli pushes at a delivery he should be leaving. It takes the outside edge and Taylor at first slip takes a simple catch in his 100th Test. The ball did not get settled into the bucket hands of Rosco but he managed somehow to hold onto it. This wicket actually reminded us of how Kohli used to get out in England in 2014. New Zealand now will be sensing an opportunity to get two more before Lunch."

He looks to play the original trajectory but the ball kisses the outside edge due to the movement and goes into the gloves of the keeper. Big wicket as CP is known to play the long innings. New Zealand are reaping the reward for bowling the right lines and lengths here. India in a spot of bother."

Southee was a little too short till now. This time he goes full. It starts on middle and then tails away late. Shaw does not do a lot wrong, he plays it with a straight bat but plays the original trajectory. The ball though shapes away just enough to beat the outside edge and kiss the off pole. Shaw looked confident in the short time he stayed out there but is done in by a beauty. Early wicket for the hosts, just the start they would have wanted after electing to bowl. Replays also show that it flicked Shaw's back pad. Also, Shaw was not exactly playing with a straight bat, it was actually towards mid on. Played all around it actually. Still though, take nothing away from the delivery. Just top class."

Colin looks to flick but it jumps and kisses the gloves. Pant takes a fine reflex catch to his left and is appealing. The umpire initially is unmoved but de Grandhomme walks. After that the official raises his finger. A very handy innings from him comes to an end. Can India now bowl out New Zealand before Lunch?"

Bumrah angles it into the batter, de Grandhomme looks to play it with a straight bat but misses to get hit on the pad. An appeal and up goes the finger. Colin de Grandhomme reviews. Replays roll in and they show that the on-field call has to be overturned."

The visitors though need to pick the remaining 5 wickets quickly as the lead is already over 50. The hosts on the other hand, know that one partnership and they would strengthen their hold on this game. There was a lot of overnight rain however it is clear now and we will have a start on time.

Both Latham and Blundell have got through the tricky period and also cut 17 runs from the deficit. More of the same is what the Kiwis would want. India, on the other hand, have not been very bad with their bowling. Bumrah has been a tad short but Ishant has been good. The wicket though seems to have eased out and it is not offering a lot of assistance. Wickets - that's the call of the hour for the visitors. Can they get a few immediately after Lunch? Do join us in a short while to find out."

There are two noises out of which one is the ball hitting the pad. An appeal and it is turned down. Kohli, after a word with his keeper and his bowler, reviews.

India, on the other hand, have two of their most defensively astute batters out in the middle. The pair of Rahane and Vihari managed to see off the day and their first aim in the morning will be to wipe out the deficit without any further more damage. It is said that the best days to bat in New Zealand in a Test match are Day 4 and 5 so will India finally put on a better display with the willow in this Test or will it be New Zealand who will run away with it?"

That though was the demand of the hour as they needed to hang in there. The visitors still trail by another 39 runs and their first aim on Day 4 will be to wipe off the deficit without losing any more wickets. Can they do so?

Colin de Grandhomme along with Kyle Jamieson and Ajaz Patel built a few handy stands.

I'll write it once again, not sure why he reviewed, he has a puzzled look on his face as he walks back but that sound could have been nothing but of the edge as the bat was not even close to touching the ground. A soft dismissal in the end. It is a full ball down the leg side, Agarwal looks to flick. There is a tickle on it. Watling takes it and appeals. Up goes the finger. Agarwal stands there for a minute, not sure why? He then starts walking. Kohli stops him and has a word. Mayank then signals the 'T'. Time for the replays and they show that the on-field call is the right one. A good innings by Agarwal comes to an end but India needed him to stay longer. They are in trouble now as they trail by another 87!"

He has been the best bowler for the hosts so far. New Zealand will hope he gets more support from the other end. India, on the other hand, need their skipper to fire and Agarwal to continue. They would hope to go wicket-less in the last session. Can they do so? We will find out in a while."

This is poor from Pujara. An error there by him. Can't leave a ball bowled by a left-arm seamer who is tailing the ball back in and bowling from around the wicket. Also, it was not that far away from the off pole to begin with. Pujara does not cover his off pole and shoulders arms to it. The ball finds the stumps. Boult is pumped up and this is exactly what the Kiwis needed. End of a stand which was looking solid. Pujara's poor run in New Zealand continues. He walks back and along with the rest of the players as IT IS TEA ON DAY 3 AND INDIA TRAIL BY 105!"

An appeal for a caught behind but it is turned down. New Zealand review. Replays roll in but from the first one it is very difficult to decide whether it is the arm guard or the glove. Hot Spot then shows a mark on the arm guard. Some more replays are seen but the umpire does not find anything conclusive to overturn the on-field decision so New Zealand end up losing their review."

It hits the higher part of the bat and goes towards square leg. Latham there takes a good catch diving to his left. Another low score for Shaw.
