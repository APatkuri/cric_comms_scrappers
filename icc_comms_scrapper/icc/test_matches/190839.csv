A length ball outside off, Ben is in two minds, whether to play at that or let it go. In the end, he does try that run-down-to-third-man shot but is late and gets a thick outside edge. Luckily for him, it goes between second slip and gully and the ball races to the third man fence. Nasser Hussain on air calls it a 'One-Day shot'. We have seen Joe Root play that shot so often in every format and even today, he was cross with himself for getting out. The reason - you can leave balls pitched outside off.

Excellent umpiring from Paul Reiffel. Length ball around off, nipping into the batsman. Malan looks to defend off the front foot, there are two noises as the ball goes to the right of the keeper. Buttler behind the stumps dives on that side and takes it just above the ground. Buttler along with the other English players put in a huge appeal but the umpire shakes his head. Stokes, Buttler, Sibley and Root all gather and have a brief chat but  Anderson is not interested at all. He starts going back for his run up. In the end, they opt against the review. Probably the last review made them not go for it for this one. Very good decision in the end not to go for the review and Anderson not being excited is justified as Ultra Edge rolls in later on and it shows that the ball had kissed the front pad and not the bat before clipping the back leg and going to the keeper. Hawk Eye then comes in and it shows that the impact was outside off and the wicket was missing too.
