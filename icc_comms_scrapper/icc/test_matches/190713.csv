Tom Blundell is the last man to get out. End of an outstanding innings. An innings of high caliber. He was going after every delivery now and departs in the attempt to do so. He steps out and hammers this low towards Lyon at mid off who seems to have taken it. The Aussie players start celebrating, the batsman is seen shaking hands with the Australians. The umpires though want to get it checked. They take it upstairs. The SOFT SIGNAL IS OUT! Replays roll in and they show it is a clean catch. AUSTRALIA WIN BY 247 RUNS!",True,62101,,
