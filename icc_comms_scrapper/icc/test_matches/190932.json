They would look to make the most of it and take an unassailable lead in this innings and would like to make it the only innings they bat in. Bangladesh, on the other hand, would try to emulate the Indian bowlers. It won't be an easy task against this juggernaut of a batting side though. Can they restrict India or will India continue to steamroll them? Join us in a while to find out."

The only thing that can be criticized off this innings from the hosts would be their catching. Apart from that they were just so magnificent making Bangladesh work for every single run. The trio of Ashwin, Umesh and Ishant scalped two each whereas Shami had 3. Jadeja was wicket-less but in his defense he just bowled 3 overs."

Mehidy looks at his partner and tries to contact with Liton but Das was busy looking somewhere else. The timer goes to off and Mehidy departs for a golden duck. How unlucky is Mehidy Hasan?

Mushfiqur Rahim is going strong for them at one end and he would look for a big score here. India, on the other hand, still remain ahead in the game and they would look to pick up further wickets. Ashwin and Ishant have bowled well but have not been able to find the edges."

The budding stand has been broken by Ashwin. How many times have we seen that? Floated on off, Mominul thinks this one would spin away and leaves it alone. The ball though straightens after pitching and goes onto hit the off pole. A slight lapse of concentration from the Bangladesh skipper has brought his downfall. He will be gutted with it. This is the 250th home  scalp for India's new spin king, Ravichandran Ashwin."

Replays roll in and Ultra Edge shows that there was an inside edge but it was after the ball had kisses the back pad as the Ultra Edge shows a spike as it goes past the back pad.. The T.V umpire after having a couple of looks rolls in the Ball Tracker. It shows that the impact was umpire's call though the pitching was on line and the ball would have hit the stumps. India don't get the wicket but also don't lose the review."

Kayes looks to defend but the ball shapes away and finds the outside edge of Imrul's bat. The ball goes uppishly to the left of gully. One with the safest pair of hands, Ajinkya Rahane moves to that side and takes a comfortable catch. It has been an excellent start by the hosts and now they have a wicket to show for it as well."

They are without their key players as Tamim Iqbal ruled himself out while Shakib Al Hasan has been banned from all forms of cricket. Although, the odds are heavily in favour of the hosts, the Bangla Tigers are capable of putting in a surprise. India, on the other hand, have been dominant in the ICC Test championship so far beating the West Indies and the Proteas in their previous assignments. They have never lost a Test match to Bangladesh and would hope to continue that run in this series as well. Their bowling has worked wonders and is in red-hot form at the  moment. Will the Bangla Tigers spring in a surprise or will the hosts continue to dominate? Toss and team updates in a while."

Further says that playing his first game in Melbourne was special and helping his side win the game was a great feeling. Adds that the plan was to build partnerships and once that happened, they looked to get quick runs. Says that he backs himself to hit the biggies. Informs that they have not thought about the declaration yet but they are in the driver's seat."

He has consistently scored well in the first innings of a Test match but today was something special. The way he attacked, the ease with which he was batting was just brilliant. He was well supported by Rahane and then Jadeja. The former missed out on a well-deserved ton whereas Jadeja has remained unbeaten at the end of the day. Umesh Yadav too enjoyed himself with the bat as he walked out to the middle before Ashwin and hit the ball to all parts of the ground. Overall, they have made the Bangladesh players toil really hard in the field and the visitors will be mentally and physically drained."

Coming to the ball, it is a flighted ball on middle, Mayank comes down the track and heaves it over deep mid-wicket for a maximum. He raises his bat and soaks in the applause from his teammates. Virat Kohli, the Indian skipper is seen signalling from the dressing room to go for the 300. Boy, Bangladesh must be ruing that dropped catch of him on Day 1."

The ball is shown to be going down leg. This is flatter and on middle, Agarwal looks to sweep but misses to get hit on the pads. An appeal and up goes the finger. Agarwal reviews. Replays roll in and they show the ball is going down the leg stump. Excellent use of the review."

They have prized out two scalps in the morning and are slightly making a comeback in this game. Coming to the ball, it is a good length ball on middle and leg, Kohli looks to flick it but misses and gets hit on the thigh pad. Jayed and the rest appeal but the umpire turns it down. The bowler then convinces his skipper to go for the review. Mominul Haque obliges. The Ultra Edge rolls in and it shows no involvement of the  bat. Then, the Ball Tracker is shown and it shows that it is going on to hit the leg stump. Good decision by the Bangla skipper to listen to his bowler. Massive wicket for the visitors. Can the visitors now make a comeback in this innings?"

Big big wicket for Bangladesh as we know Pujara, once he gets in, can play a long innings. The visitors need to keep taking wickets though in order to make a comeback."

                    "Commentary": "After bundling Bangladesh for a mere 150 runs on Day 1, an unbeaten 72-run stand between Mayank Agarwal and Cheteshwar Pujara saw the Indians dominate. The pacers made the ball talk as Shami led the pack with a 3-fer. The visitors removed the in-form Rohit Sharma early with the ball but they could not pick another wicket as both Agarwal and Pujara got themselves in. And, once that happened, runs came thick and fast for the hosts. Mayank Agarwal got a life when Imrul Kayes dropped a sitter in the slips and the opener since then did not allow another opportunity. Pujara, on the other hand, has looked at his fluent best, scoring runs at a brisk pace. Now, how will Day 2 pan out? Indian skipper Virat Kohli had reckoned that the surface will be best for batting from the second day. With 9 wickets intact, Kohli's men would want to post a mountain in front of the visitors to bat  them out and then look to bundle them again. Will they be able to do that or will the Bangladeshi bowlers be able to put the hosts under pressure with quick wickets? We will soon find out. Welcome to our coverage of the second day of this Test match."

However, Mushfiqur Rahim hung around with Mahmudullah. The latter though could not fight for long. Liton and Rahim then counter-attacked the Indian bowlers. Mushfiqur put up a fight with Mehidy Hasan but the task in hand was too much and Rahim's fighting knock was not enough for Bangladesh to avoid an innings defeat."

This partnership was starting to become the buzzing bee around Indian ears but Mehdiy has to walk back. He cannot wrap around his head with what has happened here. He is reluctant to leave but then walks back. Wicket off the first over of the session. Mehidy holds his elbow as he walks back. India are all smiles and joy at the moment."

Good length ball on off, it zips away. Mahmudullah has a poke at it but gets a thick outside edge towards second slip. Rohit Sharma there makes no mistake this time and takes a good catch to his right. Half the side back in the hut. Credit has to go to Jadeja as well as he saved runs in the previous ball which might have added a bit of anxiousness in the batsman. They trail by another massive 271 runs."

Yadav is convinced that it is out and forces Kohli to go for the review. The Ultra Edge then rolls in and it shows no bat. The Ball Tracker shows that the ball was going on to miss the off stump. India have lost their first review here courtesy of a poor decision from the Indian skipper."
