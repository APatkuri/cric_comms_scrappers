He has had a poor time so far in this Test, no wickets in the first innings, a duck that too a first ball duck with the bat but he has got the big fish, the Indian skipper who was looking solid, Virat Kohli. India are effectively 28 for 3. Once again Kohli did not need to play at that one. For the second time in this series he has fallen to a delivery which he could have easily left. It is on a length, it lands just outside off and angles away further. Maybe Kohli was worried about the ball coming back in or maybe he was just done in by the angle as Curran was constantly changing sides. Kohli has probably been sucked into the trap. He pushes at it, the ball goes off the outside edge and the keeper takes it. Kohli walks back shaking his head, he knows he has made a mistake. Still some time for Lunch, England would love another one. Also, this dismissal reminded me of how Sachin was dismissed 19 years ago to Pedro Collins. That same angle, the tall left-arm pacer, landed it around off and angled it away. Sachin poked at it, it found the edge and Jacobs did the rest.
