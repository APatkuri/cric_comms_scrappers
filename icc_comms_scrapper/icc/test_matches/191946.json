They have an uphill task ahead of them as this wicket is offering quite a bit for the spinners and Pakistan have two.

We will find out in a while."

They have one man to thank and that is Shan Masood. He was the mainstay! Yes, he was supported by Shadab and Azam but his innings could well prove to be the difference. Also, just the two 100-plus stands is what took Pakistan to a very good total. There was not a lot of contribution from the rest. Overall though, it will be the visitors who are happier after this innings."

A lot relies on him now and they would hope Shadab can provide able support as there is not a lot of batting to come. 250 is what they will be aiming for right now. Can they get there? We should find out in the next session. Do join us at 1340 Local (1240 GMT) for the Post-Lunch session."

A good one though and the Pakistan side will breathe a big sigh of relief. Another wicket would have been dreadful for them right now. Broad lands it on middle, it is on a length. Rizwan goes back to defend but it straightens. It seems to have missed the bat and hit the pad. An appeal and up goes the finger. Rizwan reviews immediately. Replays roll in and it shows the on-field call has to be overturned."

It hits the shoulder of Buttler and goes to the off side. Masood is itching to get to his fifty it seems. There is no need to go for that shot after playing so well."

They played the new ball well and got through the first hour. However, the introduction of Archer and Woakes changed things. The former got Abid Ali and the latter got the Pakistan skipper. The two did not let the batters score freely too and England would want this to continue after the break. The visitors, on the other hand, would hope that Masood who is doing well out there can continue and hope that someone can give him able support. Do join us at 1340 Local (1240 GMT) for the second session."

England appeal and the umpire raises his finger. Azhar takes the review immediately. The Ultra Edge shows no bat while the Ball Tracker shows that it is pitching in line and it is going onto hit the stumps. Poor review from the Pakistan skipper. He probably must have heard the noise of the bat hitting the pad."

Both though could not make use of the starts they got as one received a jaffa from a 17-year old and the other fell to the guile of Yasir who was the pick of the bowlers. Once Jos fell, the lower order did not contribute a lot, the last 5 wickets were shared between the two leg spinners which has seen Pakistan take a very good lead."

Gives it nice amount of loop and lands it on off, Buttler looks to play for turn, he ends up playing outside the line and also leaves the gap between bat and pad. It sneaks it through as it skidded on and clips the off pole. It was the tiniest gap between bat and pad but it goes through. The visitors will be sensing a big lead now."

Pope does all he could to keep it down. He looks to play it with soft hands and also tries taking one hand off the handle in the end. Nothing saves him as the ball keeps rising, hits the shoulder of the bat and lobs towards gully. Shadab takes it quite awkwardly. He had his body weight backwards but did well to hang onto it. He then indicates he did not see it. An important catch though as the momentum had just about started to shift. England trail by 199."

Unplayable to be honest. Stokes standing in the crease or outside wouldn't have mattered. One just gets the feeling that delivery would have gotten out many batters. It is a length delivery, slightly fuller for Stokes as he is a touch ahead of his crease. He looks to defend the original trajectory but the ball moves away and hits the top of off. Pakistan are ecstatic. They know the importance of this wicket. Waqar Younis, the bowling coach, is a pleased man as he applauds from the pavilion. Abbas would have enjoyed it as that is what you hope of, hitting the top of off as a bowler. Pakistan all over England at the moment. Mohammad Abbas just showing once again what he is capable of in England. Top class stuff."

Azhar takes the review after consulting his teammates. The Ultra Edge shows no bat and the Ball Tracker shows that it is pitching in line, impact is in line and is hitting the stumps. Burns fails and this is a terrible start for England."

They though will somehow hope the last two wickets can drag this lead to over 260. Anything above 255 or 260 will give them that psychological edge.

Shafiq walks back disappointed. Good length ball on off, Rizwan defends it to cover and takes off for a single. He is hesitant but then they decide to go for it. Sibley comes across, picks it up with one hand and has a shy at the stumps. He hits and the third umpire is called into question. From the looks of Shafiq, he thinks he is a goner. The replays roll in and they show that Shafiq is well out.  Excellent stuff from Dom Sibley."

Would have been a waste of a review. Pakistan lead by 170 runs."

Pakistan, on the other hand, need to build their lead and get to at least 300 as that will not be an easy target to chase. An interesting last passage of play awaits."

The last session is one where the ball does seem to misbehave so the home side will hope that they can make use of it. Pakistan, on the other hand, should look to be positive and look to score and put the pressure on the hosts. Easier said than done though. Join us in some time for another exciting session..."

England need to take catches like these if they want to make a comeback. This was Root's catch though. Don't understand why Stokes went for it. Good length ball on off, Abid looks to defend but it takes the outside edge and goes towards Root at first slip. Stokes at second slip has different ideas. He moves to his left and tries to take the catch but spills it. It would have been a simple catch for Root. Poor fielding. How costly will this be?"

The younger ones, the ones who lacked experience, probably crumbled under pressure and had no answers to the counterattack from the two.

Loopy ball on middle, Buttler looks to play the reverse but misses and gets hit on the pads. Pakistan appeal and the umpire raises the finger. Buttler takes the review. The Ultra Edge shows no bat and the Ball Tracker shows that it is umpire's call on impact and hitting the stumps. End of a very good innings from Jos Buttler."

Pakistan is still on top but this stand might just be getting them worried. However, they were excellent right from the word go after Lunch. They got wickets once again at regular intervals and have got rid of the top and the middle order of the England side. They would know another two wickets or so and they would be into the tail. However, Buttler and Woakes are looking pretty comfortable out there especially the latter who has come out with a lot more intent. They need to go on for longer. Another 110 runs are needed and they would want this pair to score as much as possible. Can they do so, can they continue the fightback? We will find out after the break."

Pope is caught by surprise. He looks to fend it somehow but the ball hits the glove and lobs towards the off side. Shadab Khan from gully takes a dolly. Half the side back in the hut for England.

Huge wicket as Stokes is a match-winner, the visitors are clear favourites now. Stokes was always going to have a tough time against Yasir with all the rough outside the off stump and he falls to one which lands in it. It takes off and also zips through. Stokes looks to move out of the way but it seems to have taken his glove and Rizwan initially does not take it as it pops out but he hangs on in the second attempt."

Yes, they have lost Burns but Root and Sibley have then looked to steady things and are now looking comfortable out there. However, there is still a long way to go and it will be vital for the hosts for the two to make use of the starts they have got. Pakistan, on the other hand, have bowled decently. They have hit the right lines and lengths on most of the occasions but the key here is to be patient and one feels, they would get the rewards. However, the first sessions in this Test have mostly been good for the English. It is the second session where they falter. They can't afford that now so it will be interesting to see how they go about things. Join us at 1340 Local (1240 GMT) for the second session."

Burns has a discussion with Sibley and goes for the review. The Ultra Edge rolls in and it shows no bat. What about Ball Tracker? It shows that it is umpire's call. Review retained. Burns walks off but not before engaging in some words with the Pakistan players. England still need 255 runs."
