The series starts with the WODI leg at Bengaluru before moving on to the Only Test and WT20I series at Chennai. Harmanpreet Kaur and the Women in Blue will look to start this 3 match series on a winning note and try out their combinations and preparations as a leadup to next year&#39;s WODI World Cup in India.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The last time the two teams met was in the ICC Women&#39;s World Cup in 2022, where South Africa had edged a last-ball thriller against the Women in Blue.

I thought 260 was a fairly decent score. We just needed one person to bat through, and it was fairly chasable. I think we could have been a little bit better with our control but I thought 265 wasn&#39;t too bad. I think being 30 for three is probably not ideal and we definitely need to regroup.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Harmanpreet Kaur, India Skipper:</span> </strong>&quot;It was a good team performance. We showed good energy. We have a long batting order and we know everybody cannot contribute. 2-3 players do the job and today Smriti, Deepti and Pooja did that for us. The allrounders love the format as you have time to execute your plans. Very happy with their performance and contribution to the team. We already discussed going with 5 bowlers and maybe myself, Hemalatha or Shafali will bowl 2 or 3 overs if needed. Hoping that Pooja is fine and the injury is not that bad.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Smriti Mandhana is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Smriti Mandhana: </strong></span>&quot;I&#39;m really happy that I could contribute and as we discussed, starting the series well is the most important thing. So I&#39;m really pleased that we achieved a hundred-plus run victory, nothing could be better than that. Today it was about playing the situation again. We lost a few wickets in the middle, so it was crucial to build a partnership. Credit to Deepti and Pooja, whenever they came in they kept the scoreboard moving which really helped us as set batters.&quot;</p>\n",

The South African Women&#39;s team fell short by 143 runs in their chase of a 266-run target. The Women in Blue aim to build on this momentum and clinch the series, while Laura Wolvaardt&#39;s side will be looking to rebound and keep their hopes alive.</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000\">HEAD TO HEAD:</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India Women have come out victorious on 16 occasions </span><span style=\"color:#000000\">while </span><span style=\"color:#16a085\">South Africa Women have clinched 12 games</span><span style=\"color:#000000\"> from the 29 ODI clashes between the teams.

We can see more grass compared to the last match here. It&#39;s dry, firm and looks pretty solid. Suggesting good heavy rolling since last two days. Spin won&#39;t play a role as big as the last match. There&#39;ll be a lot more runs on offer. If I was the captain, I would chase. We can even expect 300 runs on this track.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000\">TOSS:</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\">South Africa Women has won the toss and have elected to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp; first</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#16a085\">Laura Wolvaardt, South Africa Women Skipper: &nbsp;We&#39;re going to bowl first today. It&#39;s the first toss I&#39;ve won in a while. The pitch looks a bit greener, so we hope it skids nicely later under the lights. We&#39;ve made two changes today: Nadine de Klerk is back from illness and replaces Shangase, and Mieke de Ridder will make her debut as Jafta suffered a mild concussion during training yesterday.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur, India Women Skipper: &quot; We wanted to bat first. In the last game, we managed to put 260 runs on the board. Today&#39;s pitch looks even better, so we aim to adopt an even more positive approach as a batting unit. Renuka is resting today, and Arundhati is making her debut in her place.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

At the halfway stage, it would have been easy to retreat with such a huge total on the board, but Kappie did an excellent job of alleviating the pressure. We were limited in our bowling options today, and India executed their yorkers well at the death, while we conceded a few too many runs in that phase.

South Africa played really well. Our batting was on point, especially in the initial stages when the ball was moving; both openers showed great resilience and didn&#39;t throw their wickets away, making it easier for us later. We did make some errors while bowling, not always bowling according to the field. I know it&#39;s a batting track and not easy to bowl on, but we need to learn from this and adjust our strategies if we encounter similar conditions again. In our camp, all the batters tried their hand at bowling. Smriti even asked me to tell Amol that she&#39;s a great bowler, which shows how much that camp helped us. Shafali also did well with the ball, and it was good to see Smriti get a wicket. Deepti is always our strike bowler, someone who consistently takes wickets for the team. Today, I told her she was going to get a wicket when Kapp and Laura were batting, and she delivered.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

The Women in Blue will look to make it a clean sweep against South Africa and look to head into the Test and WT20I legs with momentum. The Harmanpreet-led side dominated the first WODI and etched a nervy thriller in the 2nd game of the series, with vice-captain Smriti Mandhana notching up centuries in both games and skipper Harmanpreet Kaur also getting a hundred in the previous match.

The bowlers bowled well and for us, it was just about applying ourselves with the bat. We have a series left, the Asia Cup and then the World Cup. I tried my hand in the previous game and got lucky, always good to add a different skill and if my bowling comes off then it is the best feeling.&quot;</p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Excitement is brewing in Chennai as the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium gears up to host a highly anticipated one-off Test between India Women and South Africa Women. This match holds special significance for India, marking their return to this iconic venue after a 16-year hiatus.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India arrives brimming with confidence after conquering formidable opponents like England and Australia in recent Tests. Additionally, their ODI series win against South Africa bolsters their morale. Their potent spin attack, a key factor in those victories, holds a potential advantage on the spin-friendly Chennai surface. Smriti Mandhana&#39;s batting prowess, coupled with the phenomenal form of Deepti Sharma and Arundhati Reddy, further strengthens the home team&#39;s resolve.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>South Africa, on the other hand, seeks redemption after a crushing innings defeat against Australia earlier this year. Limited red-ball preparation in their domestic circuit adds to the challenge. They will heavily rely on the seasoned all-rounder Marizanne Kapp to guide their relatively young squad. Exemplary performances from key players like Laura Wolvaardt and the pace bowling unit, spearheaded by Kapp, are crucial ingredients for South Africa to put up a competitive fight against the formidable Indian team.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This Test is enriched by its historical context and the backdrop of previous encounters where India has usually held the upper hand. Both teams boast a captivating mix of seasoned campaigners and rising talents, making the matchup an exciting spectacle for cricket enthusiasts worldwide. With the Chennai pitch traditionally favoring spinners, the strategic battle between India&#39;s spin attack and South Africa&#39;s batting will likely shape the outcome of this captivating Test.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Pitch Report (WV Raman)<br />\n&quot;It&#39;s time for the good old format at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. The pitch here is made entirely of red soil and looks very well prepared. It&#39;s hard, and in fact, the curator told me they spent 15 days preparing this pitch.As such, there will be bounce on the opening day, but it will gradually recede as the game progresses, and we&#39;ll see the spinners coming into play later on. However, the biggest challenge for the bowlers will be the fact that they need to bowl 100 overs in a day.So, it will be a test of discipline and mental stamina. As for the batters, if they can get through the first 20 minutes, it&#39;s going to be a great time for them, because the bounce will be true on the surface for the first two days. Therefore, we can expect high-quality cricket in this Test match.&quot;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE:<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"> India Won the Toss and Elected to Bat&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image - 2024-06-28T093518_1719547814.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur | India Skipper:&quot;We&#39;re going to bat first. Looking at the conditions, I think batting first will be a good option for us.We just want to keep doing the same things because, last time when we played Test matches, those things gave us the results. That&#39;s what we discussed in the team meetings as well. Whatever gave us the results, we just want to keep doing it. We have an unfortunate change. Yastika is not playing, and in her place, Shubha Satheesh is playing.I think we just want to keep things very simple because, at the end of the day, it&#39;s cricket, and we just want to keep doing what we have been doing for so many years. I know red-ball cricket brings a lot of excitement, and we just want to embrace that excitement.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Laura Wolvaardt |&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>South Africa Skipper:<br />\n&quot;Yeah, it is an awesome opportunity for us. We have three Test matches in this calendar year, and it&#39;s amazing to have more Test cricket. We&#39;re really looking forward to it. Yes, we have a few illnesses going around in our squad. Eliz-mari Marx and Tazmin Brits are missing out due to illness, but Annerie Dercksen is making her debut today. We&#39;ve had a few days of good preparation, and we know spin will play a huge factor here, so we practiced a lot of spin in the nets.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

Opting to bat first, India declared at a formidable 603/6, thanks to stellar performances from Shafali Verma (205) and Smriti Mandhana (149). Their record 292-run opening partnership set the tone, with contributions from Harmanpreet Kaur (69) and Richa Ghosh (86) bolstering the total.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>South Africa struggled in their first innings, managing only 266 runs.

Laura Wolvaardt (122) and Sune Luus (109) added 190 runs for the second wicket, but the middle order faltered again. Nadine de Klerk&rsquo;s valiant 61 helped them reach 373, setting a low target of just 37 runs for the Women in Blue. Sneh Rana got a couple of wickets and completed a 10-wicket haul in the Test.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India chased down the target without losing a wicket, with Shubha Satheesh fittingly hitting the winning runs. The victory highlighted India&rsquo;s dominance, with key performances from both bat and ball ensuring a memorable win at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Laura Wolvaardt |&nbsp; South Africa Skipper: &quot;The character shown by the group has been incredible. To concede 500 runs on day one was not ideal, and not many people felt we could take it into day four. I&#39;m very proud of the group. There are a lot of little areas you can look at. We were fighting very hard to get the draw. Each batter feels they could have hung around a little longer. Had we restricted them to a lower total, there are lots of moments we can look at. Each and every batter had the mindset to bat as long as they could. Players like Nadine and Marizanne, who are known for their attacking batting, the way they grafted was very heart-warming. I thought we had it at the end of yesterday and was really hoping we could see it out.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&nbsp;Sneh Rana (Player of the Match):&quot;Feeling really great to contribute on such an occasion. It&#39;s tough to describe in words. My body is quite fresh after fielding for so many overs. Initially, the pitch was difficult for spinners with not much turn, but later on, we got a lot of turn and bounce. The South African batters balanced the game well, but our bowling attack fought back strongly.Playing a Test match is a big deal and very special. Winning this award is beyond description. I also want to say one thing: People often say that playing off-spinners is very easy, but I hope those people got an answer today.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&nbsp;Harmanpreet Kaur | India Skipper:&quot;They batted really well. They didn&#39;t give us an easy win; we had to work hard. Credit goes to Shafali and Smriti first. Secondly, everyone contributed with the bat. It wasn&#39;t easy to field in this heat, but everyone did their part. The skippers kept believing that we could take those wickets and win the game. All of them, especially the spinners, the way they played the last two matches, they knew they could create chances. Even the medium-pacers did their job. The support staff had positive talks and kept pushing us, creating a very good atmosphere. It was a bit tough to rotate three spinners. I was eager to keep giving them the ball. Shafali and I chipped in as well. Everyone bowled well, and I&#39;m really happy with the performance. When we came in, we knew we only had 100 runs in the pocket. We had to be careful but also needed to keep looking for wickets. We planned really well and stuck to it.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

India has dominated thus far, sweeping the ODI series 3-0 and securing a ten-wicket victory in the one-off Test. With the T20I series, South Africa aims to turn the tide and end the tour on a high note.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Led by the ever-dynamic Harmanpreet Kaur, the Women in Blue are in superb form. Smriti Mandhana has been sensational, scoring heavily across formats and setting the tone for India&#39;s batting. Radha Yadav, after a stellar WPL, has returned to the national side with a bang, becoming India&#39;s top wicket-taker in the recent Bangladesh series. The squad, a blend of experienced players like Shafali Verma, Jemimah Rodrigues, and Deepti Sharma, looks well-balanced and formidable.Despite showing glimpses of brilliance, the Proteas have struggled for consistency.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The MA Chidambaram Stadium is known for its spin-friendly conditions, but recent rains could make the pitch unpredictableEvening dew could play a significant role, making chasing a strategic choice.With high stakes and intense competition, this series promises to be a gripping contest.

With the visitors leading 1-0, the hosts are poised for a spirited comeback in this T20 decider that promises more excitement than a last-ball six.After rain played spoilsport in the second T20I, leaving fans as unsatisfied as a batter stranded on 99, both teams are raring to go. India, led by the dynamic Harmanpreet Kaur, is looking to summon the fighting spirit that saw them dominate the ODIs and Test matches earlier in the tour. The Indian bowling attack, spearheaded by the ever-reliable Deepti Sharma and Pooja Vastrakar, showed marked improvement in the last match. Deepti&#39;s middle-overs magic and Pooja Vastrakar&#39;s workhorse performance have given the team a boost. Now, if they can tighten the screws in the powerplay and death overs, they&#39;ll make life hard for the Protean Batters in the middle.<br />\n<br />\nThe hosts&#39; batting lineup remains intriguingly poised. Whatever the combination, expect India to come out swinging harder than Kapil Dev in his heyday. South Africa, to their credit, have found their T20 mojo at the right time. Tazmin Brits has been in red-hot form, and skipper Laura Wolvaardt continues to lead from the front. The Proteas have proven they&#39;re no pushovers, adding a delicious tension to this series finale.As the start time approaches, all eyes will be on the sky, hoping the weather plays fair.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>So,get ready for a match that promises more drama than a Bollywood blockbuster and more twists than a mystery novel.

The Indian squad, led by Harmanpreet Kaur, has been in stellar form, recently dominating South Africa in ODIs with a 3-0 victory and drawing the T20I series. Prior to this, they swept Bangladesh 5-0 in T20Is on their home turf. The Indian team boasts a potent blend of experienced players and young talents, making them a formidable force.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Key players include the explosive opening duo of Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana, who have consistently provided strong starts. Harmanpreet Kaur and Jemimah Rodrigues fortify the middle order, while Pooja Vastrakar and Renuka Singh Thakur lead the pace attack. Spinners Deepti Sharma and Radha Yadav add further depth, making India a well-rounded team.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In contrast, Pakistan,have faced a tough run, struggling to secure wins even on home soil. Recent series saw them lose 0-3 to England and 1-4 to West Indies. Their reliance on batters Sidra Ameen and Muneeba Ali has been a concern, with the middle order needing to step up to provide more stability and resilience.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>With both teams eager to start their Asia Cup campaign on a high note and prepare for the upcoming T20 World Cup in Bangladesh, the stakes are high.

We can come back in the remaining two games.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Player of The Match: <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Deepti Sharma</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Deepti Sharma:&quot; Really happy with the performance tonight. I executed my plan well and am pleased with the result. As a unit, we worked really hard, and after the South Africa series, I focused a lot on my bowling, so I&#39;m happy with how I bowled tonight.It&#39;s always a wonderful feeling to take the wicket of their best batter, and I was very happy to dismiss Nida Dar.I didn&#39;t know about the milestone, but I&#39;m happy with my performance.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur | India Captain:&quot;Well, our bowlers and openers made it happen. The first game is always a pressure game, but we got the job done. It&#39;s important to set the tone in the first game, and whoever got the opportunity did well. When bowling, we talked about getting early wickets, and our bowlers delivered. Smriti and Shafali gave us a good start. As for the takeaway from this tournament ahead of the T20 World Cup, we just want to play well, give our best in the remainder of this tournament, and then think about the World Cup later.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n",

Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma are in top form, and their bowlers are putting immense pressure on opponents.UAE, after a tough loss to Nepal, need a win to stay in the tournament. Their top-order batters must set a strong foundation, with middle-order players like Kavisha Egodage and Khushi Sharma stepping up. The big question: Can the UAE team pull off an upset, or will Harmanpreet Kaur&rsquo;s squad continue their dominant run? Stay tuned for this thrilling encounter!</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">UAE Won the Toss and Elected to Field&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nEsha Rohit Oza | UAE Captain:<br />\n&quot;We want to bowl first.

Batting first, India set a formidable total of 201/5, thanks to fiery knocks from Shafali Verma (37 off 18) and Richa Ghosh (64 not out off 29). Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur anchored the innings with a steady 66 off 47 balls, while Smriti Mandhana added a quick 13 off 9. The UAE bowlers struggled to contain the onslaught, with Kavisha Egodage being the standout with 2 wickets for 36 runs.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Chasing 202, UAE Women were never really in the hunt, managing 123/7 in their 20 overs.

We have a game coming up against Pakistan Women, and we will look to score more with the bat.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur | India Captain:&quot;I am absolutely alright.We wanted to stay at the wicket, and I told Richa to back herself, and I think she batted really well. My role was to stay at the wicket and capitalize on the loose balls.The way Richa Ghosh batted took the pressure off me, and I am really happy with the way we played in this game. Yeah, definitely, even today, despite losing 3 quick wickets, everyone played according to the situation, and I am really pleased with the performance tonight.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Player of the Match: Richa Ghosh&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Richa Ghosh:&nbsp;&quot;I am really happy because when I play with Harmanpreet Kaur, she always guides me on how the ball is coming onto the bat and the behaviour of the pitch, so I really enjoy it. When I get the chance, I just want to perform based on what I know and have been practising. The first cover drive was my favourite.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>It&rsquo;s the final showdown in Group A of the Women&rsquo;s Asia Cup! Unbeaten India face Nepal at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium today, July 23. With a semifinal spot on the line, Harmanpreet Kaur&rsquo;s squad is laser-focused on clinching a win.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India is currently leading the points table with two wins from two matches, totalling 4 points. Their performance has been dominant, with the bowlers setting the tone against Pakistan and the batters shining against the UAE. Key contributions from players like Shafali Verma, Richa Ghosh, and Harmanpreet Kaur have been crucial. Despite losing Shreyanka Patil to injury, Tanuja Kanwer has stepped up admirably. Consistent performances from Renuka Singh, Pooja Vastrakar, and Deepti Sharma have been the backbone of their success.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nWith high stakes, Nepal aims to channel their early success and challenge the defending champions. For India, a win secures their semifinal spot and reinforces their status as tournament favourites. Will Nepal rise to the occasion, or will India continue their dominant run?&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE:<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"> India Won the Toss and Elected to Bat&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Smriti Mandhana | India Captain:&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;We would like to bat first today. In the last few years, T20 has changed, so it&#39;s a collective effort to attack. Whatever is in the batter&#39;s range, they go after it. The outfield is really quick, and sometimes even 200 is not enough.</span></strong><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">We are really looking forward to trusting the process. We aim to bat well for the full 20 overs. Anything above 180 would be great. It&#39;s not about thinking too far ahead, but about focusing on each ball at a time.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&nbsp;Indu Barma | Nepal Captain:</strong><strong>&quot;We are ready for both batting and bowling. We have some eager youngsters ready to join the competition. We&#39;re prepared for any challenge and will give our all. We&#39;ve made two changes.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Opting to bat first, India posted a formidable 178/3 in their 20 overs, led by a blistering 81 off 48 balls from Shafali Verma. Dayalan Hemalatha added 47 off 42 balls, while Jemimah Rodrigues&rsquo; quickfire 28 off 15 balls provided the finishing touches.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Nepal&#39;s bowlers struggled to contain the Indian batters, with Sita Rana Magar (2/25) being the standout performer. Chasing 179, Nepal could only manage 96/9 in their 20 overs. Arundhati Reddy struck early, removing both openers, and Deepti Sharma spun a web around the Nepal batters, claiming 3 wickets for 13 runs. Radha Yadav also chipped in with 2 wickets, ensuring a smooth passage for India to the semis.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Shafali Verma&rsquo;s explosive innings and Deepti Sharma&rsquo;s stellar bowling highlighted India&#39;s all-round dominance.

We have realized our weaknesses and we will come back stronger. We respect our opponents. We got great exposure playing against India.I am happy with my team. After the 10th over, our bowlers gained good momentum. I got lots of experience, and my teammates gained a bunch of experience playing against India and Pakistan.

I&#39;m becoming more consistent and working on finishing strong. I saw the fielder and aimed to hit the ball along the ground. Scoring 200 runs is significant for a batter, and since I wasn&#39;t in great form before, this innings really boosted my confidence.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Smriti Mandhana | India Captain:&quot; As an opener, it&rsquo;s rare not to get a chance to bat, so I&#39;m really happy with how things went. Shafali batted brilliantly, and Hema also got some runs. We finished well as a team. I think it was much-needed game time for all the batters, especially since the middle order hasn&rsquo;t had many opportunities to bat in the last two T20 series. So, I was really happy with how it turned out, and we finished off well too.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n",

With a spot in the grand finale at stake, anticipation is high. India have been dominant throughout the tournament. Led by the dynamic Harmanpreet Kaur, they have cruised through the group stage with convincing wins over Pakistan, the UAE, and Nepal. Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma have been explosive at the top, while Jemimah Rodrigues and Richa Ghosh have provided solidity in the middle.<br />\n<br />\nThe Indian bowlers, led by Renuka Singh, Deepti Sharma, and Radha Yadav, have been clinical, consistently dismantling opposition lineups. After a shaky start against Sri Lanka, Bangladesh bounced back with wins over Thailand and Malaysia to secure their semi-final spot. India&#39;s historical dominance over Bangladesh in T20Is adds to their confidence. This match will test Bangladesh&rsquo;s ability to counter India&rsquo;s formidable bowling attack. With clear skies and perfect cricketing conditions, we can expect an exciting semi-final.</strong></p>\n",

After winning the toss and opting to bat, Bangladesh struggled to find momentum. Renuka Singh Thakur&#39;s exceptional spell of 3/10 in four overs set the tone early, dismantling the top order. Nigar Sultana, the captain, managed a gritty 32 off 51 balls but received little support from her teammates. Radha Yadav also shone with the ball, claiming 3/14 as Bangladesh limped to 80/8 in their 20 overs.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Chasing a modest target of 81, India&rsquo;s openers Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana made light work of the Bangladeshi bowlers.

When we play against India, our batters play differently. We need to work on our batting unit, and I think our coaching staff will come up with different techniques to improve.It was disappointing that Rabeya couldn&#39;t get strike in the end, but I&#39;m sure she will continue to do better in the games to come.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Player of the Match - Renuka Singh&nbsp;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Renuka Singh :&quot;I&#39;m really happy with the award because it means we are into the finals now.

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>As the sun rises on another thrilling Asia Cup final, the stage is set for a clash of titans. India, the perennial powerhouse, are poised to defend their crown against a determined Sri Lankan side eager to rewrite history.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India&rsquo;s journey to the final has been nothing short of spectacular. They&rsquo;ve steamrolled their way through the competition, leaving a trail of defeated teams in their wake. Their 10-wicket demolition of Bangladesh in the semifinals was a testament to their dominance, even with a shuffled lineup. D Hemalatha has been a revelation at no. 3, stepping up in the absence of Smriti Mandhana, while Deepti Sharma&rsquo;s precision with the ball has been unmatched. Shafali Verma and Renuka Thakur have found their rhythm, and Tanuja Kanwer&rsquo;s tight spells have added depth to an already formidable squad.On the other side, Sri Lanka, under the leadership of Chamari Athapaththu, have been equally impressive. Athapaththu&rsquo;s blazing form, earning her three Player of the Match awards, has been the cornerstone of their campaign.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The memory of last year&rsquo;s one-sided final still lingers, but this time, Sri Lanka has the advantage of home support. They are more than ready to challenge India&rsquo;s supremacy and carve out a historic victory.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Will India continue their reign, or will Sri Lanka rise to the occasion and claim the title?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE:&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India Won the Toss and Elected to Bat first&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Harmanpreet Kaur | India Captain: &quot;We are going to bat first. Both the semis were played on this pitch, which is why we chose to bat first. We worked hard, and that&#39;s why our batting line-up looks strong. They are a good side, but we are focused on what we need to do. We are playing with an unchanged 11.</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff3300\"><strong>Chamari Athapaththu | Sri Lanka Captain:&quot;If we had won the toss, we were looking to bowl first.

Smriti Mandhana was the top scorer with a well-crafted 60 off 47 balls, while Richa Ghosh added a quick 30 off 14 deliveries. Kavisha Dilhari was the pick of the bowlers for Sri Lanka, taking 2 wickets for 36 runs.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In response, Sri Lanka had a shaky start, losing Vishmi Gunaratne early. However, captain Chamari Athapaththu played a captain&#39;s knock, scoring a brilliant 61 off 43 balls, including nine fours and two sixes. Harshitha Samarawickrama provided excellent support with an unbeaten 69 off 51 balls, and Kavisha Dilhari&rsquo;s rapid 30 off 16 balls ensured Sri Lanka reached the target with ease, finishing at 167/2 in 18.4 overs.

Special thanks to Harshita and Dilhari for their performances. It&#39;s not a one-man show; the coaching staff has been great, and finally, we have won the Asia Cup&mdash;special thanks to the Sri Lankan crowd for their support. I&#39;m really happy.

Led by Harmanpreet Kaur, the squad has a strong blend of experience and youthful firepower, ready to dominate the competition.<br />\n<br />\nIndia&rsquo;s batting lineup boasts heavyweights like Shafali Verma, Smriti Mandhana, and Kaur herself, all eager to regain form after a mixed bag in warm-ups. The key anchor, Jemimah Rodrigues, brings stability to the middle order, while the hard-hitting Richa Ghosh and dependable Deepti Sharma offer finishing power.<br />\n<br />\nTheir first challenge is New Zealand, a team looking to reverse a poor run of form. While the White Ferns have struggled recently, they still have match-winners like Sophie Devine and Amelia Kerr, and can&rsquo;t be underestimated.<br />\n<br />\nIndia&rsquo;s bowling attack, led by a potent spin trio&mdash;Deepti Sharma, Radha Yadav, and Shreyanka Patil&mdash;will look to exploit Dubai&rsquo;s turning pitches. Renuka Singh Thakur spearheads the pace department, adding versatility to the attack.<br />\n<br />\nIndia know that a strong start is critical in this World Cup and they&rsquo;ll be determined to make an early statement. Stay tuned as India kicks off its quest for glory in what promises to be an exhilarating World Cup!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nHead-To-Head in T20 World Cup</strong><br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/BCCI(ICC 2024) Head to Head - 640px width (13)_1728048052.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report | Nasser Hussain and WV Raman:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Nasser: &quot;We&#39;re here for the second game of this double-header. The ground looks in great shape, and it&#39;s cooled down a bit. Temperatures should drop to around 31 degrees Celsius as we head into the night. Let&rsquo;s talk about the ground dimensions&mdash;53m and 63m for the square boundaries, while the straight hit is 73m. Definitely some shorter areas to target. I&#39;ve got WV Raman with me. What&rsquo;s your take on the pitch? Do you expect it to change as the game goes on?&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Raman: &quot;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll see much change. There&rsquo;s plenty of dry grass on the surface, which suggests we&rsquo;ll get some bounce and pace. Later on, we might see a bit of turn, but I don&#39;t expect dew to be a factor tonight.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE: New Zealand Won the Toss and Elected to Bat&nbsp;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sophie Devine | New Zealand Captain:<br />\n&quot;We&#39;re happy to bat first tonight on this fresh surface and are excited to give it a go.Our preparation has been good, and we&rsquo;re looking forward to starting our campaign. After watching the previous game, we know the pitch might play a bit slower, but we&rsquo;ll focus on taking regular wickets to maintain control.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Harmanpreet Kaur | India Captain:<br />\n&quot;We would have chosen to bat first too. We aim to go out and play quality cricket.All our players have a fearless approach. They&#39;re always looking to take the aggressive option, and I love that. I believe this is the best team we&#39;ve had for a T20 World Cup.</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Opting to bat first, the White Ferns got off to a flying start with Suzie Bates and Georgia Plimmer laying a solid foundation. Despite a mid-innings wobble against spin, captain Sophie Devine&#39;s unbeaten 57 off 36 balls steered New Zealand to a formidable 160/4.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India&#39;s chase faltered from the outset, losing key wickets in the powerplay including Shafali Verma, Harmanpreet Kaur, and Smriti Mandhana. The asking rate climbed steadily as New Zealand&#39;s bowlers maintained pressure. Lea Tahuhu (3/15) and Rosemary Mair (4/19) were particularly impressive, systematically dismantling India&#39;s batting lineup. India were eventually bowled out for 102 in 19 overs, falling well short of the target.<br />\n&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Harmanpreet Kaur | India Captain:</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;We definitely didn&rsquo;t play our best cricket today. Moving forward, we need to focus on the areas where we can improve and bring our A-game in the upcoming matches.We created chances, but unfortunately, we couldn&rsquo;t capitalize on them. Credit to New Zealand&mdash;they played better cricket. Our bowlers did a decent job, but fielding errors cost us. In high-pressure games like this, you can&rsquo;t afford those mistakes.We&rsquo;ve chased 160-170 targets before, but today we weren&rsquo;t expecting 160 on this pitch. I feel we gave away 10-15 extra runs. Losing wickets regularly hurt us, and going forward, we need to learn how to handle such situations better.That said, we still managed to keep them in check after their strong start. I thought they were on track for 180, but we pulled it back. This is a tough group, and though it&#39;s not the start we wanted, we need to regroup and work on both our bowling and batting strategies.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Sophie Devine | Player of the Match &amp; New Zealand Captain:</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>&quot;Honestly, the foundation set by Bates and Plimmer got us going. We talked about maximizing the middle overs, around 7-12, and while we slowed down a bit, I&rsquo;m happy we pushed through to post a good total in the end. The pitch wasn&rsquo;t easy to bat on, especially with pace off, making it tough to find gaps. I had to muscle a few shots to get to the boundary, but I knew if I spent time in the middle, I could catch up later. This team has worked incredibly hard over the past six months, and it&rsquo;s great to see it paying off today. I&rsquo;m proud of this group&mdash;we&rsquo;ve been targeting this game for a long time. We take inspiration from the Black Caps, and our powerplays have been excellent recently, giving us strong starts. Today, we wanted to put pressure on the bowlers, and we felt 150 was par. Getting 160 was a bonus. We know our opposition well, having played them recently, but it&rsquo;s always a big challenge facing teams like Australia.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Arundhati Reddy starred for India, taking 3/19. India&#39;s chase began cautiously, losing Smriti Mandhana early. Shafali Verma (32) and Jemimah Rodrigues (23) steadied the ship with a 43-run partnership. Despite a mid-innings wobble, captain Harmanpreet Kaur&#39;s composed 29 guided India close to victory before retiring hurt. Deepti Sharma and Sajeevan Sajana finished the job, with Sajana hitting the winning boundary in the 19th over. The win gives India a perfect start to their World Cup campaign, while Pakistan must regroup quickly.

It was a day game, and the heat and humidity were challenging, but we&#39;re used to playing in these conditions back home. I just stuck to the plan and focused on attacking the stumps.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Fatima Sana | Pakistan Captain:<br />\n&quot;We weren&#39;t up to the mark with our batting, which left us 10-15 runs short. Hopefully, we&#39;ll reshuffle the batting order. I&#39;m really enjoying my time with these girls.

As a fielding unit, there&#39;s a little room for improvement, but we&#39;re happy to get our first win.&quot;Yeah, we definitely thought about it, but Shafali and I were struggling to time the ball properly. So, we tried to be calculative, ensuring we didn&#39;t lose too many wickets and put pressure on ourselves. We wanted to get over the line comfortably.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Set for October 9th at Dubai&#39;s iconic International Stadium, this match promises to be a nail-biter that could make or break either team&#39;s tournament dreams.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>India enters the fray with renewed confidence after a commanding six-wicket victory over arch-rivals Pakistan. With a 1-1 record in the tournament so far, the Women in Blue are eager to build on their momentum. The dynamic duo of Shreyanka Patil and Arundhati Reddy showcased their bowling prowess in the previous match, stifling Pakistan to a mere 105/8. The chase was then expertly navigated by the formidable batting trio of Shafali Verma, Jemimah Rodrigues, and captain Harmanpreet Kaur.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>On the flip side, Sri Lanka finds itself in dire straits after two consecutive defeats. The island nation&#39;s hopes now hinge on a mathematical tightrope walk &ndash; they must not only win their remaining matches but do so convincingly while hoping for favorable results elsewhere. All eyes will be on the usually dependable batting pair of Samarawickrama and Chamari Athapaththu, who have yet to leave their mark on this tournament.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>As the tension mounts, cricket fans worldwide are curious: Which team will rise to the occasion and keep their World Cup dreams alive? Will India continue their upward trajectory, or can Sri Lanka orchestrate a stunning turnaround?</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>With both teams hungry for victory and fully aware of the consequences of defeat, we can expect a fiercely contested match filled with drama, skill, and perhaps a few surprises.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India Won the Toss and Opt to Bat first&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Harmanpreet Kaur | India Captain: &quot;We&rsquo;ve decided to bat first.

No matter where we go, they&rsquo;re (fans) always there to support us, and I think that&rsquo;s a real privilege. We&rsquo;re very grateful for their support, wherever we play.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000099\"><strong>Chamari Athapaththu | Sri Lanka Captain: &quot;Honestly, I feel the conditions are slow and low, but we&rsquo;re sticking to our plans and hoping to play our best cricket today. Yes, definitely, we need to be fearless during the middle overs.In the powerplay, we can take bigger risks, but after that, it&#39;s crucial to keep the scoreboard ticking by rotating the strike.

This win comes with sweet revenge, as India avenged their Asia Cup final defeat and effectively knocked Sri Lanka out of the semis race.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>It all began when India won the toss and chose to bat. Openers Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma put on a spectacular show, hammering 98 runs for the first wicket. Mandhana showcased her class with a solid half-century, but a moment of misfortune saw her run out immediately after. Shafali, who was striking at a run-a-ball, fell for 43 soon after. Captain Harmanpreet Kaur then took charge, smashing a rapid 50 off 27 balls, leading India to an imposing total of 172/3.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sri Lanka&#39;s chase never took off, courtesy of Renuka Singh Thakur&rsquo;s lethal new-ball bowling. She dismissed Vishmi Gunaratne for a duck, and the big blow came when Shreyanka Patil claimed the prized wicket of Chamari Athapaththu, leaving Sri Lanka reeling at 3/6 in the Powerplay. The damage was done early, and the pressure never eased. Despite a brief partnership between Kavisha Dilhari and Anushka Sanjeewani, the rest of the lineup crumbled, with Sri Lanka bowled out for 90 in 19.5 overs.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India&rsquo;s bowlers were in sublime form. Arundhati Reddy and Asha Sobhana each picked up three wickets, while Renuka and Shreyanka chipped in with crucial scalps. Their fielding was equally exceptional, turning half-chances into wickets and keeping the Sri Lankan batters under constant pressure.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This emphatic win not only secures India&rsquo;s second place in the group standings but also significantly boosts their Net Run Rate, inching them closer to a spot in the semifinals. The Women in Blue have sent a clear message to the rest of the tournament: they mean business!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Harmanpreet Kaur | Player of the Match:<br />\n&quot;We just aimed to keep the momentum going. Smriti and Shafali gave us the perfect start, which is exactly what we had planned. We focused on the importance of not losing wickets unnecessarily, regardless of the situation. Full credit to both of them for staying sharp and playing smart shots without taking unnecessary risks. Even after we lost two quick wickets, Jemimah and I focused on maintaining the run rate around seven to eight per over, and things just flowed from there.&quot;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000099\"><strong>Chamari Athapaththu | Sri Lanka Captain:<br />\n&quot;We really struggled with our bowling today&mdash;missed a few catches and the bowlers didn&rsquo;t get their line and length right. Even the batters didn&rsquo;t step up, so we need to go back and review what needs to be improved.Yes, the first game of the tournament is always crucial. We lost a low-scoring contest against Pakistan, which brought down the morale in the dressing room. But these things happen in cricket. We&rsquo;ve got one more game to turn things around.I&rsquo;m satisfied with my bowling performances overall, not so much today, but in the previous two games, we&rsquo;ve bowled well.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur | India Captain:<br />\n&quot;You always want to feel good about your performance, and today we ticked all the boxes. We batted, bowled, and fielded well, which was really satisfying. Fielding has been a focus, and it was great to take all our catches.We had discussed our targets before the game, but these tricky pitches mean you have to adapt. We lost two quick wickets, which required us to stay on our toes, but things went according to plan. We aimed for 160 and ended up with over 170, which was crucial. In situations like this, it&rsquo;s not just about winning but also improving net run rate. We need to focus on playing good cricket against Australia. Our bowlers are in rhythm, and while Australia is a tough side, we&rsquo;re delivering key breakthroughs. We just need to keep bowling well and not overthink the opposition, especially with these unpredictable wickets.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

The Women in Blue, having recovered from a shaky start, are now eyeing a semi-final spot with laser focus. But a simple win won&#39;t be enough&mdash;they need to beat the defending champions by at least 61 runs to leapfrog Australia and keep their T20 dreams alive.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India&rsquo;s dynamic duo, Harmanpreet Kaur and Smriti Mandhana, have been on fire, and they&rsquo;ll need to bring their A-game to tackle Australia&rsquo;s bowling spearheaded by the ever-dangerous Ashleigh Gardner. With the Aussies missing key players like Tayla Vlaeminck and captain Alyssa Healy nursing injuries, this could be India&#39;s golden opportunity to strike.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>But there&rsquo;s more at play than just this match. If New Zealand also win their game, the battle for the semi-finals will come down to the mysterious Net Run Rate&mdash;adding even more tension to an already nerve-wracking situation.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India isn&rsquo;t just aiming to win&mdash;they&#39;re going for a victory so commanding, it&rsquo;ll make the Taj Mahal look small. Will they pull off this cricketing masterstroke and secure a spot in the final four? Or will Australia prove too tough a nut to crack? One thing&#39;s certain&mdash;this T20 showdown will have fans glued to their seats and calculators at the ready!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#16a085\">Australia Won the Toss and Elected to Bat&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Tahlia McGrath | Australia Captain:<br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\">&quot;We&#39;re going to bat first and aim to put a good total on the board.It&#39;s our third game here, so we&rsquo;ve adapted well to the conditions and are excited for today&rsquo;s match.It&#39;s play-on for now, and we&rsquo;ll focus on the important game ahead.

We&rsquo;ve made a few plans for this game, and hopefully, we can execute them well.We have the confidence to beat them, as we&rsquo;ve done it before.

India came out strong, as we expected, but I&rsquo;m really pleased we managed to get over the line.The atmosphere was intense, with most of the crowd supporting India. It was loud and challenging, but having so many fans made it special, especially in a World Cup. Our experienced players handled it well.(On Qualifying for the Semi-Finals) It&rsquo;s huge for us. Any game against India is marked on our calendars because we know it&rsquo;ll be a great contest.&quot;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur | India Captain:<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;I think their entire team contributed. They didn&rsquo;t rely on just one or two players, and they have strong all-rounders. They can adapt their plans based on the situation and pitch. It&rsquo;s not that we didn&rsquo;t have plans; we did. But they didn&rsquo;t give us easy runs. They&rsquo;re definitely an experienced side, having played together in multiple World Cups, and that makes a big difference.(On Asha&#39;s injury) That&rsquo;s something you can&rsquo;t control. You have to manage with 13-14 players. Radha was ready to step up. She was fully involved in the game, fielded well, and gave us the breakthrough when we needed it. You need characters like her in the team.We assessed the conditions well and knew we could chase the total. When Deepti and I were batting, we missed out on capitalizing on a few loose balls. They&rsquo;re an experienced side, and we need to learn from them.We&rsquo;ve done everything within our control. If we get the chance to play another game, that would be great. If not, then the team that deserves it will move forward.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tahlia McGrath | Australia Captain:<br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\">&quot;We knew India would be a tough opponent, and we aim to win every game, so I&rsquo;m really proud of the team for coming away with the win.(On Captaincy) As soon as Healy got injured, I knew I had to step up and lead the side. Everyone has been fantastic, backing me throughout, and I&rsquo;m really happy we got the result.The wicket started slowing down as the game went on, with the ball stopping on the surface and some keeping low. Given those conditions, we did well to post a solid total and then defend it.We were constantly discussing the par score, and the batters in the middle knew the situation. They played with freedom, and I&rsquo;m really pleased with everyone&rsquo;s contributions.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

While they&rsquo;re riding high on their recent success, the likes of Sophie Devine and Suzie Bates will find India a far tougher challenge on their home turf, where spinners like Radha Yadav can work their magic.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India already holds a spot in the 2025 ODI World Cup, and this series is the perfect stage to show their dominance and turn the tide in their favor.

The stage is set for a thrilling showdown in Ahmedabad.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nPitch Report | WV Raman: &quot;The weather is perfect, with clear skies and plenty of sunshine. The pitch looks well-prepared, with a bit of grass on the surface, though it will likely dry out due to the heat. We have an exciting contest ahead between India and New Zealand, two top international sides. India have been strong in ODIs, while New Zealand has struggled in this format. There are plenty of runs to be made here, despite the average score being 207. Given the conditions, the captain winning the toss should look to bat first, build up a big total, and put pressure on the opposition.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Smriti Mandhana will be stepping in as the stand-in captain for today&#39;s match, with Harmanpreet Kaur sitting out due to a minor injury.</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div><strong>TOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India won the Toss and elected to bat&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image (1)_1729759921.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</div>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>The historic Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad is set to come alive this Sunday as the Indian Women&rsquo;s cricket team looks to clinch the ODI series against New Zealand&rsquo;s White Ferns. Fresh off a solid win in the first match, India is just one victory away from sealing the series with an unassailable 2-0 lead in this three-match showdown.<br />\nNew Zealand, however, faces a tough challenge as they are without one of their star players&mdash;Amelia Kerr, the standout performer from the T20 World Cup&mdash;who&#39;s sidelined with a quadricep injury. On the Indian side, the focus remains on captain Harmanpreet Kaur&rsquo;s availability after she missed the series opener.<br />\nIn the first ODI, India&rsquo;s batting lineup showed depth and promise. Debutant Tajal Hasabnis led the charge with a composed 42 runs, while the reliable middle-order duo of Yastika Bhatia (37) and Deepti Sharma (41) played crucial knocks, helping India post a competitive 227 on the board. For New Zealand, the Kerr sisters were the pick of the bowlers, with Amelia grabbing 4/42 and Jess taking 3/49.<br />\nIndia&rsquo;s bowlers then put on an impressive display. Radha Yadav stood out with figures of 3/35, while another debutant, Saima Thakor, made an immediate impact by taking 2/26, including the key wicket of Suzie Bates. Despite some resistance from Georgia Plimmer (25) and Amelia Kerr (25 not out), New Zealand fell short, getting bowled out for 168.<br />\nAs the teams gear up for the second ODI, it promises to be an exciting contest between India&rsquo;s crafty spin attack and New Zealand&rsquo;s batting lineup. Both sides will be looking for stronger performances at the top of the order, with Smriti Mandhana for India and Sophie Devine for New Zealand eager to make a mark after quiet starts. The battle in the middle order, though, could ultimately tip the scales.<br />\nWith a blend of experienced players and emerging talents, India finds itself in a strong position to secure the series. Meanwhile, New Zealand will be digging deep, hoping to draw on their championship spirit to turn the tide and keep the series alive.<br />\n<br />\nPitch Report:- WV Raman</strong><br />\nWe&#39;re looking at quite a distinct surface for today&#39;s match. Unlike the previous game where we had a pure red-soil wicket, this one presents an interesting blend of red and black soil. They&#39;ve selected pitch number 6 for this encounter. The straight boundary measures 69m at its maximum, and batters should expect some variation in both bounce and pace throughout. The conditions will certainly test batting technique and adaptability.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Toss: </strong>New Zealand won the toss and decided to bat first!&nbsp;</p>\n",
        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000\">Powerplay (1 - 10 Overs) :</span><br />\nNZ - 46/0 (4.60 rpo, 9x4, 0x6)&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#000000\">ll </span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">IND - 47/3 (4.70 rpo, 3x4, 2x6)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#000000\">Middle Overs (11 - 40 Overs) :</span><br />\nNZ - 133/4 (4.43 rpo, 12x4, 1x6)&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#000000\">ll </span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">IND - 118/5 (3.93 rpo, 12x4, 0x6)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#000000\">Death Overs (41 - 50 Overs) :</span><br />\nNZ - 80/5 ( 8 rpo, 10x4, 1x6)&nbsp;ll&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">IND - 18/2 (2.51 rpo, 1x4, 0x6)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>New Zealand Women have levelled the series 1-1 with a solid 76-run win, showcasing their depth. After losing the first match, the White Ferns bounced back impressively. Electing to bat first under the intense Ahmedabad heat, New Zealand&rsquo;s openers Georgia Plimmer and Suzie Bates laid a strong foundation with an 87-run partnership. Suzie Bates reached a well-earned half-century, scoring 58, while skipper Sophie Devine anchored the innings with a vital 79, helping New Zealand post a challenging total of 259/9. Maddy Green also played a handy knock of 42. Radha Yadav was the standout for India with her all-round performance, grabbing 4 wickets and taking three sharp catches, while Deepti Sharma, Saima Thakor, and debutant Priya Mishra also contributed with crucial breakthroughs. Chasing 260, India Women showed resilience despite an early setback of Smriti Mandhana. Although Yastika Bhatia and Shafali Verma departed for 12 and 11 respectively, the returning Harmanpreet Kaur combined with Jemimah Rodrigues to build a promising 38-run partnership. Even after their dismissals, Radha Yadav and Saima Thakor fought hard, stitching together a record 70-run stand for the 9th wicket, keeping India&rsquo;s hopes alive. Radha&rsquo;s all-round efforts and Saima&rsquo;s gritty 29 showed promise, but the team was eventually bowled out for 183 in 47.1 overs. Lea Tahuhu and Sophie Devine took 3 wickets each, with Jess Kerr and Eden Carson picking up two apiece. India can take plenty of positives from their fighting spirit and look forward to bouncing back in the series decider.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur (India Women Captain): &quot;We conceded too many runs and missed key catches, which hurt us. Despite that, with the batting lineup we have, it was still a chasable target. It was encouraging to see Radha and Saima fight towards the end. But during the chase, we kept losing wickets and struggled to build partnerships. We aimed to win, but we fell short today. Dropping their main batters and giving away easy runs cost us. It can be frustrating when Radha puts in her best effort, but we still leak boundaries. We need to improve as a unit. Like I said at the toss, these girls are committed and eager to play for the country. It&#39;s great to see them seize their chances. However, we need to work on our fielding we have to back our bowlers better. And with the bat, we need to step up and take responsibility.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Sophie Devine (Player of the match, New Zealand Captain): &quot;It was a well-rounded performance today, with contributions from everyone. We probably left 15-20 runs out there with the bat, but it&#39;s great to come away with the win. We talked a lot about building strong batting partnerships, and it was great to see Maddy Green and Izzy Gaze execute that plan well, playing with intent, taking their time initially and then attacking the bowlers. Suzie was brilliant, almost like a vintage performance is just outstanding. Losing a key player like Amelia Kerr is tough, but it makes my job easier when others step up and deliver. Now, we move to the series decider. We&rsquo;re aiming to put in a similar performance on Tuesday, staying sharp in the field and tightening things up where needed.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

The stage is set for an epic decider after India&#39;s commanding 59-run victory in the opener was countered by NZ&#39;s resilient 76-run win.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The spotlight remains on India&#39;s young sensation Tejal Hasabnis, the series&#39; leading run-scorer, while debutant Saima Thakor&#39;s pace bowling has added fresh firepower to India&#39;s attack. Radha Yadav&#39;s all-round brilliance makes her one to watch.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>For the White Ferns, Sophie Devine&#39;s leadership has been exemplary - her match-winning 79 and three wickets in the second ODI showcasing her class. Despite missing Amelia Kerr, the experienced duo of Suzie Bates and Georgia Plimmer have stepped up admirably.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Ahmedabad pitch has offered something for everyone&mdash;batters finding value for shots while spinners extracting turns. With temperatures soaring, endurance will be key.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Can Harmanpreet&#39;s India clinch it on home soil, or will Devine&#39;s Kiwis seal a memorable away series? Don&#39;t miss this blockbuster finale!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nPitch Report | WV Raman:<br />\n&quot;The decider is on Pitch 7, and conditions are bright and sunny. The dimensions are similar: 69 meters downtown, 58 square, and 53 behind. The surface is hard and dry, with 100% red soil, so we&rsquo;ll see some extra bounce. Spinners have been pivotal so far, and the middle phase will be key; the team with better shot selection will likely come out on top.&quot;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#000000\">New Zealand Won the Toss and Elected to Bat&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nSophie Devine | New Zealand Captain:<br />\n&quot;We&rsquo;ll bat first again today. We did a great job last game, and with the pitch unlikely to change much, we&rsquo;ll look to post a solid total. (On her 150th ODI appearance) It&rsquo;s an honor, although it also means a few more warm-ups and ice packs! I&rsquo;ll reflect on the milestone later&mdash;right now, we have a job to do. The team&rsquo;s consistency has been fantastic, something I&rsquo;m proud of, and we&rsquo;ve stayed strong no matter the results. It&rsquo;s all about giving it our best on the field, and we&rsquo;ve played solidly in both games. Just one change for us: Hannah Rowe replaces Jess Kerr.&quot;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Yes, we would have batted first as well. After the last game&rsquo;s defeat, we had an in-depth meeting, and the team is very positive about this match. Partnerships are key for us; we&rsquo;ve emphasized the importance of each batter building partnerships and taking responsibility to bat deep into the innings. The team is looking focused and positive for this fixture. Playing a home series always brings some added pressure, but we&rsquo;ve performed well at home, and today is another chance for us to give our best and clinch this series. We have one change: Renuka Singh Thakur comes in for Arundhati Reddy.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

After seven long weeks on the road, some well-deserved rest is finally in sight. Smriti Mandhana&rsquo;s hundred today was extraordinary. We took our cues from the World Cup, focusing on hitting the stumps&mdash;a strategy that usually works well here. Tahuhu was giving it her all, sprinting on one leg, and Melie Kerr pushed through despite her injury.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Smriti Mandhana | Player of the Match:</strong><br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;I&#39;m really pleased with my performance tonight, especially since it helped us clinch the series. Like I mentioned after the first match, it&rsquo;s been a tough month and a half for this team. The first two games didn&rsquo;t go my way with those single-digit scores, so tonight I was really determined to make an impact for the team. My focus today was all about controlling my shots, staying disciplined, and batting through those crucial first 10 overs before building on my innings.I believe there are always different approaches, but for me, the harder way&mdash;playing for the team&mdash;is what I prefer. Every time I get out cheaply, I feel like I&#39;ve let my team down, so performing well really gives me peace of mind. As a cricketer, you experience highs and lows, but the key is to keep pushing forward.&quot;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;I&rsquo;m very pleased with the result. As I mentioned this morning, we had some important discussions, and it feels great that we managed to execute our plans. Whenever we step onto the field, we aim to give 100%, even though things don&rsquo;t always go our way. As professional cricketers, it&rsquo;s essential to keep pushing forward. We emphasized this in our team meeting, so it&rsquo;s especially rewarding to come back strong after our last loss.&nbsp;I have to give credit to Smriti; she was struggling early on, but she dug deep and got the runs we needed. That was crucial, as we were determined to win this series. I&rsquo;m really happy with our partnership today.&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Deepti Sharma | Player of the Series:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;I always try to enjoy myself on the field and adapt to the conditions to deliver for my team. Honestly, it&rsquo;s about having confidence and trusting in my abilities. I was focused on making a strong comeback, and that self-belief really helped me perform today. I definitely work on adjusting my pace based on the conditions and the batter I&rsquo;m facing, using my skills to bowl better with each game. Moving forward, I&rsquo;ll stick to my approach but keep pushing to improve and perform even better in the matches to come.</strong></span></p>\n",

The atmosphere is charged with excitement as these two top teams clash in what promises to be an intense battle.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India arrive in Australia with renewed confidence after their 2-1 series win over New Zealand at home. However, despite their recent success, they are yet to win an ODI series against Australia on Australian soil, having lost 12 of their 16 previous encounters. The team will be eager to break this jinx and make a strong statement against the hosts.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>For India, this series is not just about correcting past records but also about building momentum for the 2025 Women&#39;s ODI World Cup. With a mix of seasoned stars and promising new talent, this squad has a lot to prove. Smriti Mandhana, Jemimah Rodrigues, and Deepti Sharma, who have all been in excellent form in the WBBL, will be crucial to India&rsquo;s chances. The experience of these key players, combined with the youthful energy of newcomers like Uma Chetry, Titas Sadhu, and Saima Thakor, gives India a well-rounded side that is more than capable of challenging the Aussies.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The likes of Mandhana, Rodrigues, and Sharma, who have been honing their skills in Australia through the WBBL, will be looking to use their familiarity with local conditions to their advantage. India&#39;s bowlers, including the talented Rajeshwari Gayakwad and Renuka Singh, will also play a pivotal role in containing the Australian batting order and ensuring India keeps the pressure on.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India&rsquo;s focus will be on building partnerships, both with the bat and the ball, as they look to outsmart the Australians on their home turf. With the 2025 Women&#39;s ODI World Cup already in their sights, every series from here on is a step towards preparing for that challenge.<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India Won the Toss and Elected to Bat first</span></strong></p>\n",

While we didn&rsquo;t post enough runs on the board, the bowlers gave their best and fought hard, managing to take five wickets.A few of us got starts with the bat, but we couldn&rsquo;t capitalize on them. We need to focus on building better partnerships to set a stronger total. There are a few areas we need to reflect on before the next game. We had to adjust to the conditions and the pitch. We need to have a clear target in mind when batting first. We now have a better understanding of the situation and will approach the next game with a positive mindset.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tahlia McGrath | Australia Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;It was really important for us to start the series on a strong note today. My job was made easy by the exceptional bowlers the fielders, who were outstanding, and of course, Volly, who had a fantastic debut.It&rsquo;s always rewarding when the plans come together &ndash; when the bowlers execute their strategies and the fielders back them up. We did that well today, and I couldn&#39;t be happier with how everything clicked. What impressed me most was Volly&rsquo;s composure and confidence. To open the batting on debut and play shots like that right from ball one shows just how special her talent is. Chasing low totals can be tricky, but we aimed to be aggressive. The wicket looks challenging for batting, so we&rsquo;re already thinking ahead and coming up with ideas for how we can either set big totals or chase them down effectively.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

However, we ended up falling a bit short with the runs. Created some chances with our bowling but couldn&#39;t quite grab them. Have to give credit where it&#39;s due, they batted well. We need to reassess our bowling plans, as we didn&#39;t get the movement we were expecting here. Moving forward, we need to focus on batting through the full 50 overs. Got several 40s but we know we need to convert those into fifties and hundreds.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tahlia McGrath (Australia Captain)</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;Look, Voll&#39;s hundred was outstanding - she just looked in complete control from the start. Those drives down the ground showed her class, and honestly, it was hard to see how they&#39;d get her out. Might have tried pushing her back but she was just too good today.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>And then there was Perry - intent clear from ball one, especially with those sixes. That&#39;s exactly what we want - taking the game on and building that platform. The whole top four executed perfectly.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>Managing the bowling was interesting - when you&#39;ve got seven options, every change becomes a real decision. We kept it simple today with short spells, mixing things up. Looking forward to the WACA - should get a bit more bounce there.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Ellyse Perry (Player of the Match)<br />\n&quot;It was a completely different match compared to the last one. Really pleased with how everyone contributed through the order, giving us that solid platform. Our bowling unit showed good persistence even though the wicket wasn&#39;t offering much today. Still see room for improvement, which is exciting. We&#39;ve got such a strong lineup, and it&#39;s about everyone maximizing their role, whatever that might be on the day. The discussions around this have been positive, and everyone&#39;s embracing the challenge of taking our game forward. The way we started really set things up nicely, and it was great to be part of it.&quot;</strong></p>\n",

After two challenging matches, the visitors aim to harness their evident potential, demonstrated through Richa Ghosh&#39;s adaptability at the top order and Jemimah Rodrigues&#39; promising innings in the previous game.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The series has revealed valuable insights into India&#39;s evolution, which is particularly relevant as they prepare to host next year&#39;s World Cup. While the second ODI saw India post a respectable 249/9, with notable contributions from Harmanpreet Kaur and Rodrigues, the team recognizes the need to convert these starts into match-winning performances.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Today&#39;s match at the pace-friendly WACA offers India&#39;s lineup a crucial opportunity to fine-tune their skills. With possible adjustments in the bowling combination and Priya Punia&#39;s fitness being monitored, India looks to demonstrate their resilience and tactical acumen on this historic ground.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE:<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"> India Won the Toss and Elected to Field&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n",

Set a challenging target of 299 runs, India&rsquo;s chase faltered as they were bowled out for 215 in 45.1 overs.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Australia&rsquo;s innings, led by a superb 110 from Annabel Sutherland, set the tone for the match. Contributions from Ashleigh Gardner (50), Tahlia McGrath (56 not out), and Phoebe Litchfield (25) ensured Australia posted a competitive 298/6 in their 50 overs. The innings also saw valuable partnerships, with Sutherland&#39;s brilliance guiding Australia through the middle overs.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In reply, India&rsquo;s top-order showed promise, with Smriti Mandhana scoring a well-made 105. However, India struggled to maintain the tempo as key wickets fell. Australia&rsquo;s bowlers, particularly Ashleigh Gardner (5 wickets for 30), took control, restricting India at crucial intervals. Despite spirited efforts from players like Mandhana and Harleen Deol, India was unable to chase down the target, finishing their innings at 215 all out.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Annabel Sutherland&nbsp; | Player of the Match &amp; Player of the Series:<br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\">&quot;I thought the Indian girls, especially the quick bowlers, bowled really well and picked up key wickets. Gardner and I just tried to take it deep and then capitalize when the opportunity came.Climbing up the order is never easy, but the girls have done it beautifully throughout the series. We&#39;ve had some great discussions about our approach, and it&rsquo;s really satisfying to see our plans come together and get the win.For me, it&#39;s about managing my body, especially with all the travel. It&rsquo;s important to put in the work during the pre-season and stay fit throughout the matches.&quot;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur | Indian Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;I think we bowled well, especially Arundhati Reddy, who was exceptional with her 10-over spell. Her performance kept us in the game.Credit goes to Australia for their impressive performances with both bat and ball throughout the series. We&rsquo;ll take a lot from these matches and analyze everything when we go back home&mdash;looking at where we went wrong and how we can improve.There were definitely positives, with Smriti&rsquo;s performance tonight being a standout. We did well in patches, but we weren&rsquo;t consistent enough. We&rsquo;ll have discussions on how to address this and focus on improving moving forward.Next, we&rsquo;re heading to Mumbai and then facing the West Indies in a home series.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tahlia McGrath | Australia Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;I&rsquo;m really happy with that performance. Ash and Belsy were outstanding with both bat and ball. They really helped shift the momentum in our favour.What&rsquo;s been most pleasing throughout this series is that someone has stepped up in different situations. We&rsquo;ve backed each other, and I&rsquo;m really excited to secure the win.For me, the batting was the real highlight. The way we played in game two, with our top four getting runs on the board, was fantastic. Belsy was also brilliant with the ball. We need to focus on our bowling execution, but overall, it&#39;s been great to finish with a win.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

After a challenging Australian tour, the hosts are eager to reset and find their rhythm in the shortest format.</p>\n\n<p>The series presents an opportunity for fresh faces in the Indian squad, with Nandini Kashyap and Raghvi Bist earning their maiden call-ups. The team&#39;s core remains strong with vice-captain Smriti Mandhana, who recently showcased her form with a century, alongside the explosive Richa Ghosh and the versatile Deepti Sharma.</p>\n\n<p>The visitors, led by the dynamic Hayley Matthews, arrive with momentum from their T20 World Cup semifinal appearance. Matthews, fresh from her WBBL heroics with Melbourne Renegades, will be crucial to their campaign. While they&#39;ll miss the experienced Stafanie Taylor, the return of Shabika Gajnabi and Rashada Williams strengthens their lineup.</p>\n\n<p>Though India holds a historical advantage in this matchup, West Indies&#39; recent T20 form makes them formidable opponents. With both teams featuring a mix of experience and emerging talent, cricket fans can expect an engaging series that could go either way.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS: <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">West Indies have won the toss and have elected to field</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Hayley Matthews, West Indies Skipper</strong>:</span>&nbsp;&quot;We are going to bowl first.

We had good net sessions and we just want to play our best brand of cricket.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur, India Skipper</strong>:</span>&nbsp;&quot;We would have also bowled first. We just want to play a good brand of cricket in this series. We have done really well, especially in India and this is our first game in India after the World Cup.&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Saima Thakor is making her debut</strong></span>.&quot;</p>\n",

India&rsquo;s top order gave a rollicking start and managed to build partnerships, with the highest partnership being 81 runs between Mandhana and Rodrigues, after which some aggressive batting in the end from Richa Ghosh and skipper Harmanpreet Kaur ensured that the Women in Blue posted a challenging total on board.</p>\n\n<p>In the chase, India picked up crucial wickets and kept the scoring in check during the Powerplay, building the initial momentum. Qiana Joseph (49 off 33 balls) and Deandra Dottin (52 off 28 balls) were the standout performers, but wickets in regular intervals, led by Deepti Sharma and Radha Yadav, ensured there was no easy way for West Indies to chase down the target, restricting them to 146/7, and securing a comfortable victory. This win gives India an early lead in the series as they look to build on their momentum.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Hayley Matthews, West Indies Skipper:</strong></span>&nbsp;&quot;We were probably a bit loose with the ball and also let ourselves down in the field at times. But there were some positives like Qiana striking the ball, and Dottin giving us hope. The girls have had a few days to know the conditions, and the preparation has been pretty good leading up to the series. We back ourselves to chase anything but yes they got 15-20 runs too many. There were a few massive overs that got the game away from us.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Smriti Mandhana, India Stand-in Skipper:</strong></span>&nbsp;&quot;Harmanpreet is doing fine. She is being taken care of by the medical team and hopefully will be fine soon. Uma came in and got us off to a good start, Jemi came in and continued the momentum. Credit to the bowlers with so much dew around. After winning also, we have to go back and review where we can be better. We had Sajana as our 6th bowling option but our first five bowlers did a good job. Sajana has been bowling well in the domestic games, and we have the extra option.if needed&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Jemimah Rodrigues is the Player of the Match</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Jemimah Rodrigues</span>:</strong>&nbsp;&quot;Really happy. More happy that we won the game. It has been a lot of cricket lately and it is challenging to keep yourself mentally fresh. I spoke to Smriti recently and I am happy that I could execute the plans. The plan was to get to 200, we could have pushed a little bit, we know what West Indies and Dottin can do, but the bowlers did a fine job in restricting them.&quot;</p>\n",

West Indies&#39; strategy demands sharper execution, particularly in the powerplay where India&#39;s dynamic top order has proven formidable.The Navi Mumbai evening conditions could play kingmaker, with the surface traditionally offering something for both batters and bowlers. The toss might prove crucial, as teams navigate the dew factor under lights.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This encounter transcends mere statistics &ndash; it&#39;s about West Indies&#39; resilience against India&#39;s home dominance. Matthews&#39; tactical acumen will be tested against India&#39;s well-oiled machinery, while the hosts aim to maintain their aggressive brand of cricket that&#39;s rapidly becoming their hallmark in T20Is.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Smriti Mandhana Will Captain the Women in Blue today&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">West Indies Won the toss and Elected to Bowl&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\nHayley Matthews | West Indies Captain:<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"> &quot;We&#39;ll bowl first as conditions favor chasing.

However, our bowling unit performed exceptionally last game, and we&#39;re confident about defending again today.

We needed to be more sensible and could have scored 10-15 additional runs as a batting unit. We&#39;ll take this defeat and learn from it.While dew wasn&rsquo;t a significant factor in the first 10 overs of their bowling, we know it will play a role later on. As a team, we need to prepare better for such conditions. We&#39;ll practice under wet conditions and hopefully return stronger in the next match.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hayley Matthews | West Indies Captain &amp; Player of the Match:</strong> <span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;We realized we didn&#39;t perform our best in the previous game, but today the team came prepared and the result was clear. We assessed the score at the halfway point and recognized that Smriti batted exceptionally well. Kudos to players like Deandra and others who stepped up and bowled effectively during the latter part of the first innings.We were pleased with scoring 160 and knew that with strong batting and building partnerships, we could chase it down. &quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Each team enters this clash having notched a commanding victory, setting the stage for a gripping contest.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Smriti Mandhana, stepping in seamlessly for Harmanpreet Kaur, has impressed with consecutive half-centuries, providing class and assurance at the top. The rest of India&rsquo;s batting lineup, brimming with promise and skill, will look to build around her solid starts. In the bowling department, Titas Sadhu and Radha Yadav have shown spark, while experienced campaigners like Renuka Singh Thakur and Deepti Sharma are eager to hit their stride under the spotlight. Familiar conditions and passionate home support could further bolster India&rsquo;s challenge.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>For the West Indies, Hayley Matthews remains the fulcrum. Her unbeaten 85 in the previous match underscored her status among cricket&rsquo;s finest all-rounders. With Henry and Fletcher offering variety and bite, the visitors boast an attack capable of challenging India&rsquo;s confident stroke-makers. Tighter fielding will only enhance their advantage.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>All told, this finale promises a showcase of talent, temperament, and tension&mdash;an ideal finale for a captivating series.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">West Indies Won the Toss and Elected to Field&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hayley Matthews | West Indies Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;We&#39;re quite fortunate this series and will opt to bowl first again.

As an allrounder, Aaliyah adds depth to our batting lineup.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Smriti Mandhana&nbsp; | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We would have preferred to bowl first, but the toss isn&rsquo;t in our control. We need to bat well and put up a strong total. With dew around, anything above 185 should be good, and we&rsquo;re ready to do whatever it takes to secure a win.We have a very young team filled with fresh faces.

Captain Smriti Mandhana once again led from the front, registering her third consecutive fifty of the series, displaying remarkable consistency and class at the crease. The rest of the batting lineup well supported Mandhana&rsquo;s fluent stroke play, as they built partnerships and kept the momentum high. Later in the innings, Richa Ghosh provided the ideal finish, hammering a blistering fifty off just 21 deliveries, taking India&rsquo;s total beyond the visitors&rsquo; reach.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Chasing an imposing target of 218, West Indies struggled to find their footing. They lost wickets at regular intervals and never truly challenged India&rsquo;s bowlers. Radha Yadav stood out with the ball, claiming four crucial wickets to derail the chase. Although Deandra Dottin and Chinelle Henry offered brief resistance, their efforts proved insufficient against a well-disciplined Indian attack that maintained pressure throughout ending West Indies innings at 157/9.<br />\n<br />\nHayley Matthews : (West Indies Captain)</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;We had a tough night with the ball, honestly.

While our batting continues to show promise, our bowling discipline let us down tonight. Some players didn&#39;t meet expectations, but there are still positives we can build on looking forward.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Richa Ghosh : (Player of The Match)</strong><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Smriti and Raghvi perfectly set the platform, but I just wanted to keep that momentum going. When I see deliveries in my zone, I back myself to clear the ropes, doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s ball one or the last ball, that&#39;s my natural game.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>I practice exactly like this in the nets - it&#39;s all about executing what I train for. Getting this opportunity felt great, and even better that I could deliver for the team when it mattered.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Smriti Mandhana: (India Captain and Player of The Series)</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Breaking our five-year home series drought feels special - it finally reflects the cricket we&#39;re capable of playing. With three young talents in our lineup, I knew I had to shoulder more responsibility. It wasn&#39;t just about timing the ball well, but about leading from the front, especially after losing every toss.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harman&#39;s absence in the middle order was significant - she&#39;s our backbone there. But I&#39;m proud of how everyone stepped up. Raghvi showing such courage, hitting that six so early in her career - that&#39;s something special. And Richa, what a performer! She was incredible today, took the game away completely. This win is about the entire team rising to the occasion.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>The action shifts to Vadodara&#39;s Kotambi Stadium as India Women take on West Indies Women in the first of three ODIs on Sunday. Fresh from their record-breaking T20I performance, the hosts will look to bounce back in the 50-over format after a recent setback in Australia.India&#39;s squad sees some fresh faces with Tanuja Kanwar and Pratika Rawal earning maiden call-ups. Captain Harmanpreet Kaur, who missed the latter part of the T20I series, is expected to return, joining the in-form Smriti Mandhana to strengthen the batting lineup.For West Indies, the series carries extra significance as they chase World Cup qualification points. Currently ninth in the rankings, they need four wins from their remaining six matches to secure automatic qualification. The return of powerhouse Deandra Dottin to ODIs after nearly two years significantly boosts their chances.The visitors, led by the dynamic Hayley Matthews, will be eager to improve upon their previous ODI outing in India, where they faced a whitewash eight years ago. With both teams showing similar win rates in ODIs this year and the Kotambi Stadium pitch being relatively untested, the series opener promises an intriguing battle between two well-matched sides.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">West Indies Won the Toss and Elected to Field</span></strong></p>\n\n<div><br />\n&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div><strong>Pitch Report by WV Raman:&nbsp;The conditions at the BCA stadium are excellent. The outfield is lush and well-maintained. The weather is pleasant, and the pitch appears in great shape. The longest boundary measures 69 metres, with square boundaries at 59 metres and 52 metres behind the square. The pitch, made of black soil, is well-rolled, firm, and has a touch of grass. It promises good bounce, giving batters a great chance to score runs. The ball should come nicely onto the bat, setting the stage for a high-scoring game.</strong></div>\n",

Despite Zaida James&#39;s impressive five-wicket haul (5/45) for the visitors, India&#39;s batting depth proved too much to handle.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The West Indies chase crumbled under the brilliance of Renuka Singh Thakur, who recorded her career-best figures of 5/29. Her new-ball spell set the tone as she dismantled the top order with precise swing bowling. Only Afy Fletcher showed some resistance with an unbeaten 24, but it was far from enough as the visitors were bundled out for 103 in 26.2 overs. The emphatic win gives India a 1-0 lead in the three-match series&nbsp;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hayley Matthews | West Indies Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;Yeah, we probably weren&#39;t on the mark today. Obviously, all three phases of the game went against us, and this isn&#39;t the kind of cricket we want to play.I think we need to get back to the training ground, improve, and work harder. We&#39;ll have off days like this, and we need to try and bounce back from these situations.We were aiming for around 270-280, but we didn&#39;t finish well with the ball. Also, if we field better, it will definitely save us a few more runs.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;I must credit our physio team; I&#39;ve been battling a knee issue for a while. Thanks to Rajni sir, our physio, and our fielding coach for their support. I&#39;m happy with how things are shaping up.Smriti&#39;s batting may look effortless, but it&#39;s far from easy. Renuka has been fantastic for years, and today&#39;s five-wicket haul was extra special. It&#39;s great to see how well we&#39;ve been fielding, both in the previous series. I&#39;m pleased with our approach. Playing in India is enjoyable. The facilities are top-notch, and we enjoy performing at home. The pitches and grounds are wonderful.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Renuka Singh Thakur | Player of the Match:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;The team really motivates me. Harman asked if I wanted to bowl, and my confidence grew with each wicket. We focused on spot bowling for ODIs and worked on single-wicket deliveries. Jhulan Goswami also shared valuable tips. It&rsquo;s tough for bowlers since lines and lengths differ from T20s, but practice helps us deliver. Whatever we prepare for, that&rsquo;s what we execute on the field.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>India will look to seal the series against West Indies in the second ODI at Vadodara&rsquo;s Kotambi Stadium. The hosts delivered a masterclass in the opener, crushing the visitors by 211 runs. Batting first, India posted a formidable 314/9, thanks to Smriti Mandhana&rsquo;s brilliant 91 and a strong debut by Pratika Rawal, who scored 40. Contributions from Harleen Deol and Jemimah Rodrigues added to India&rsquo;s dominance. Zaida James shone for the visitors, picking up a maiden five-wicket haul, but the lack of support from her teammates and poor fielding let West Indies down. In response, Renuka Singh Thakur dismantled the Windies with her maiden ODI five-for as the visitors folded for just 103. West Indies&rsquo; batting collapsed under pressure, with only Afy Fletcher showing some resistance. Heading into the second ODI, West Indies must regroup quickly, particularly in batting and fielding, to stay alive in the series. Meanwhile, India, riding high on confidence, will aim to replicate their all-round performance and secure a comprehensive series victory.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nPitch Report | WV Raman:</strong><br />\n<strong>&quot;Conditions are fantastic as we&rsquo;ve shifted from pitch 6 to pitch 7. The square boundaries are 58 meters, and it&rsquo;s 69 meters down the ground. The surface appears slightly drier with less grass, making it ideal for batting. Bowlers will need to stick to straighter lines to find success. Overall, it&rsquo;s a batting-friendly pitch, but crafty bowlers can still make an impact&quot;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE:<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"> India Won the Toss and Elected to Bat&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We are going to bat first.

We need to focus on bowling better, restricting them, and picking up crucial wickets.This series is extremely important for us, especially with those two World Cup qualification points at stake. We&rsquo;ll take tomorrow to rest, enjoy Christmas, and then get back to work.&nbsp;It was a bittersweet moment.

The way our bowlers were bowling, I had the trust that we will win this game. We leaked a few runs but Deepti came back into the attack and took the big wicket. Really happy with the performance.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Harleen Deol | Player Of The Match:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&nbsp;&quot;Definitely, a proud moment for me. Enjoying it. Actually when I came into bat, I had much time. I knew the more I play, the more shots I play, that is what was on my mind.&nbsp;When you are batting well, you are batting well, there is nothing special in it.&nbsp;Definitely, it means a lot to me. Scoring the century was special and the ultimate goal was to make my team win.&nbsp;For me, it is the first one. I don&#39;t know about the scrappy ones. For me, one or two shots did not come off. My partners told me not to go for them and I listened to them.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

All-rounder Orla Prendergast&#39;s performance in subcontinental conditions could prove crucial, while wicketkeeper Joanna Loughran replaces the injured Amy Hunter.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The series carries ICC Women&#39;s Championship implications, particularly for Ireland, which needs qualifier points for the 2025 World Cup.

Captain Gaby Lewis anchored the innings with a patient 92 off 129 balls, supported by Leah Paul&rsquo;s fluent 59. However, tight bowling from India, particularly by Priya Mishra (2/56) and Deepti Sharma (1/41), kept the Irish scoring in check.India&#39;s response was led by an explosive start from captain Smriti Mandhana, who struck a blistering 41 off 29 balls. Pratika Rawal then took charge with a superb 89 off 96 deliveries, combining steadiness with flair. Tejal Hasabnis provided the finishing touches with an unbeaten 53 off 46 balls, ensuring a smooth chase.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gaby Lewis | Ireland Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;Yeah, I&rsquo;m feeling good. Just a cramp, but it&rsquo;s fine now. There are definitely positives to take from this match&mdash;we&rsquo;ve improved a lot compared to how we played in Bangladesh.I&rsquo;m delighted with the effort. Credit to Leah as well; after we lost a few quick wickets, she batted brilliantly. Transitioning from the conditions in Bangladesh, where the wickets were so different, this was a solid performance. I&rsquo;m proud of the team.I&rsquo;m particularly pleased with the fielding and the way our spinners bowled. We had a discussion about those areas, and it&rsquo;s great to see improvement game by game. That&rsquo;s the kind of progress&quot;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Smriti Mandhana | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;To bowl on this kind of wicket, which didn&rsquo;t offer much, our young bowlers did a commendable job. And in batting, the way Pratika and Tejal finished things off was exceptional.You need to understand your bowlers&#39; strengths, and their execution of slower balls and bouncers was key on this pitch. While we&rsquo;re happy with the win, we would&rsquo;ve loved to restrict them to around 180.There&rsquo;s a lot of preparation behind the scenes, and that will be crucial in the next 7-8 months. People see what happens on the field, but our work off the field is equally important.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pratika Rawal&nbsp; | Player Of The Match:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Yeah, I think so. I feel comfortable here; it helps a lot. I always enjoy the kind of shots Smriti plays&mdash;it really eases the nerves.We were just trying to keep it simple. Starting at 67 without loss gave us a great platform, and we built on that momentum. Everyone chipped in and made their mark.Honestly, no. I just focus on doing what I do best without worrying too much about the result. If the ball is in my slot, I go for my shots; otherwise, I just look for singles.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Jemimah Rodrigues played a scintillating knock, scoring her maiden ODI century, while Smriti Mandhana, Pratika Rawal, and Harleen Deol made valuable contributions, each scoring fifties. The Indian batting line-up found boundaries effortlessly, putting Ireland on the backfoot right from the start.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In response, Ireland struggled to chase down the daunting target of 371. Regular wickets fell, and although keeper-batter Coulter Rally showed resilience with a brilliant 80-run innings, it wasn&rsquo;t enough. India&rsquo;s bowlers dominated, with Deepti Sharma picking up three wickets and Priya Mishra contributing with two crucial breakthroughs. Despite a late fight, Ireland finished at 254/7, handing India a comprehensive victory and a 2-0 lead in the series.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gaby Lewis:&nbsp; Ireland Captain</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>&quot;There are still plenty of positives to take from this game. We managed to put up a better total than the last match, and it&rsquo;s encouraging to see different players stepping up in different games.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Christina showed real fearlessness out there, and it&rsquo;s a testament to the hard work of the coaching staff. They&rsquo;ve been doing a fantastic job, and it&rsquo;s great to see that reflected in our performances.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Smriti Mandhana:&nbsp; India&nbsp; Captain</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We won the toss and chose to bat, and I&rsquo;m really happy with the overall performance. Jemi, Pratika, and Harleen played brilliantly to get us to 370. The fielding unit also put in a great effort, which was very pleasing to see.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>It&rsquo;s a new partnership with Pratika, and I&rsquo;m delighted to have her at the other end. She has a mature head on her shoulders, and together we focus on taking singles and doubles, which has been key to our three 100-run partnerships.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>This is a World Cup year, and I&rsquo;m especially excited about our new bowling unit. While they are new at the international level, they&rsquo;ve been standout strike bowlers in domestic cricket and bring plenty of variations to the table. It&rsquo;s a blessing to have them in the side, and I&rsquo;m confident they&rsquo;ll continue to deliver.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jemimah Rodrigues: Player of The Match</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;I&rsquo;m relieved to get runs under my belt. I&rsquo;ve scored a lot in domestic cricket, but the roles here have been different, especially since I&rsquo;ve played more T20s. I tried to stick to the way I play in the domestic circuit, but adapting to this format has taken some time.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>I usually bat at No. 5, so patience is key. It&rsquo;s about hitting the gaps and keeping the scoreboard ticking. We had a clear plan to bat till the 40th over, and when I was taking my time, my partner stepped up and took charge.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>We&rsquo;ve played a lot of cricket together, even if not always batting together, and that understanding really helped us build a strong partnership.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

As hosts, India has dominated the series, winning the first two games convincingly, and now seeks to complete a clean sweep. The team has displayed remarkable consistency, with different players rising to the occasion in crucial moments.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Pratika Rawal has been a standout performer, smashing two fifties in as many games, while skipper Smriti Mandhana, Harleen Deol, and Jemimah Rodrigues have also delivered key contributions with the bat.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Ireland, on the other hand, will aim to avoid a whitewash and secure valuable Championship points. Their batting unit has shown potential with multiple contributors, but their bowling attack has yet to pose a significant challenge to the formidable Indian lineup. A determined effort will be required for Ireland to turn the tide in the final game.<br />\n<br />\nToss Update:- <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India won the toss and opted to bat first!&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\nSmriti Mandhana:-</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;We don&#39;t have a target in mind, just want to see how it goes. A lot of game time for the batters. I am really happy that everyone has the game time. You have to be vocal [as captain]. We have two changes&nbsp;</span><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Saima Thakor and Priya Mishra have been rested, Tanuja Kanwar and Minnu Mani come in.&quot;</span><br />\n<br />\nGaby Lewis:-</strong><br />\n&quot;<span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>We would have chosen to bat as well.

Batting first, India unleashed a batting masterclass, amassing their highest-ever ODI total of 435/5 in 50 overs. Pratika Rawal starred with a sensational maiden century, scoring 154 runs in a stunning display of stroke play. Captain Smriti Mandhana added to the carnage with her 10th ODI century, anchoring the innings with elegance.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In the final overs, Harleen Deol and Richa Ghosh provided fireworks, propelling India to a mammoth total. Ireland&#39;s bowlers struggled to contain the onslaught, with no bowler managing to make a significant impact.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Chasing an improbable target of 436, Ireland faltered early and never recovered. Orla Prendergast and Sarah Forbes showed resilience with the bat putting up a 64-run stand for the third wicket, but their efforts were insufficient against India&#39;s disciplined bowling attack. Ireland was eventually bowled out for 131 losing their last seven wickets for just 31 runs, falling well short of the target.<br />\n<br />\nGaby Lewis (Ireland Captain)</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>&quot;It&rsquo;s been the first time playing in India for a few of our players, and the experience has been fantastic&mdash;the atmosphere, the people, and the noise have all been amazing. There&rsquo;s been a lot to learn, especially coming up against world-class players. The team put on a great show today, and it was really exciting to watch.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;(</strong></span><strong>On Qualifiers Game Plan): -</strong><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Our focus will be on consistency with both bat and ball. There are plenty of positives to take from this series. Different players stepped up at different times, which highlights the depth we have in the group. That&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ll aim to build on as we move forward.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Pratika Rawal (Player of The Match and Series)</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;It&rsquo;s a great start to the January season, and I&rsquo;m very happy with how things have gone. It&rsquo;s always special to score runs, but doing it for the country means so much more&mdash;it&rsquo;s definitely a confidence booster. I&rsquo;m really happy with my performance throughout the series.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>I had the celebration in my mind&mdash;the moment I kiss the helmet&mdash;and I was visualizing that as I approached the milestone. It was something I really wanted to do, and it felt amazing to finally execute it.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Watching Smriti bat is such a treat&mdash;it all looks so easy when she&rsquo;s at the crease. I don&rsquo;t mind taking a backseat when she&rsquo;s batting because it&rsquo;s just incredible to watch her in action.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Smriti Mandhana (India Captain)</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;I am really pleased that all the girls got game time. The centuries and fifties from the batters have been fantastic. I&rsquo;m especially happy for Jemi, Harleen, Pratika, and Richa&mdash;they&rsquo;ve all contributed brilliantly. The bowlers also executed the plans perfectly, which was great to see.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Except for my dropped catch, I&rsquo;d say it was a near-perfect game. Winning the toss, choosing to bat, and scoring 400+ was a huge positive. The way Richa and Pratika batted was outstanding, and the bowlers finishing things off in the 31st over was superb.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>It was a planned approach. I was just thinking, there aren&rsquo;t many matches where you get the chance to go out and attack freely, so I decided to try a few shots. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t. Fortunately, today it did.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>There&rsquo;s plenty to work on. As much as we want to enjoy this victory, we need to stay focused and prepare for the World Cup. Fielding and running between the wickets will be critical over the course of 50 overs&mdash;those 300 balls are where we can make a real difference. If we can excel in these two areas, we have the potential to do something special.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",
