        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Just a week following their T20 World Cup triumph, the men in blue set off on a new journey, this time under the leadership of Shubman Gill, with VVS Laxman accompanying him as coach. Team India is scheduled to face Zimbabwe in a 5-match T20 series, with Sikandar Raza captaining the opposing team. Following the retirements of Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and Ravindra Jadeja, the team is entering a transition phase, offering young and promising talents like Riyan Parag, Harshit Rana, Abhishek Sharma, and others the opportunity to display their skills in the blue jersey. The next generation of the Indian team will be eager to step up and replicate their impressive domestic performances on the international stage. Meanwhile, Zimbabwe, having missed out on a T20 World Cup spot, will be looking to secure some victories against this youthful Indian side.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Head to Head :</strong><br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/BCCI(ICC 2024) Head to Head - 640px width (5)_1720261943.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nTino Mawoyo: &quot; There is a slight covering of grass, which will dry out quickly. The surface is expected to remain consistent throughout the game and is considered a good batting wicket. Although the average score at Harare in the last 10-12 games has been around 150, that total likely won&#39;t be sufficient on this pitch.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India has won the toss and has elected to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;first</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Shubman Gill, Indian Skipper: &quot;We will bowl first. The pitch seems favourable, and it should remain consistent throughout the game. This victory has been a long time coming; winning an ICC event after 11 years is a significant achievement. There are always expectations you set for yourself. We have three players making their debuts today: Sharma, Jurel, and Parag.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Sikandar Raza, Zimbabwe Skipper: &quot;I don&#39;t mind batting first. The pitch looks favourable. Zimbabwe Cricket has entrusted me with guiding the team through this transition phase. I expect the young players to step up and show their determination. It&#39;s an honour to lead this group. With Sean&#39;s retirement, we have a young squad, and Ervine will play a significant role in the future.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

Our performance wasn&#39;t up to standard, and everyone seemed a bit rusty. We had discussed taking our time and enjoying our batting, but it didn&#39;t turn out that way. By the halfway mark, we had lost 5 wickets. It would have been ideal if I had stayed till the end, so I am very disappointed with how I got out and how the rest of the match unfolded. There was a glimmer of hope for us, but when you&#39;re chasing 115 and your number 10 batter is out there, you know something has gone wrong.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Sikandar Raza is Player of the Match&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/double-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /></span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Sikandar Raza, Zimbabwe Skipper: &quot;I feel really happy about the win. We need to take it one game at a time because the job is not done and the series is not over. World champions play like world champions, so we need to be ready for the next game. This isn&#39;t a wicket where you get bowled out for 115, so credit to the bowlers of both sides. It&#39;s clearly an indication that we need to up our skills. I said I don&#39;t care about the result as long as we stay true to the crowd and the changing room. We had our plans, we stuck to them, and we backed our guys. Our catching and ground fielding were amazing, but we did make some errors, which shows there&#39;s room for improvement. We knew the fans would lift us up and give us energy, and credit to them&mdash;it really helped us.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

We intended to bowl first regardless. The atmosphere in the changing room is relaxed and upbeat. We&#39;re taking it one game at a time, focusing on our purpose here and aiming to complete our task.

Yesterday, our issue was more about handling the pressure, which was tough for our young team experiencing their first international exposure. We still have three matches to go.

The five-match T20I series between India and Zimbabwe hangs in the balance at 1-1, setting the stage for a pivotal third encounter.After a shock upset in the opener, the Men in Blue roared back with a clinical 100-run demolition job. Now, with the series on a knife-edge, both sides are pulling out all the stops.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>India&#39;s camp is buzzing with the return of their T20 World Cup heroes - the explosive Yashasvi Jaiswal, the dynamic Sanju Samson, and the hard-hitting Shivam Dube. Skipper Shubman Gill finds himself in the enviable position of having to juggle a star-studded lineup. Meanwhile, Zimbabwe&#39;s talismanic leader Sikandar Raza is rallying his troops, determined to recapture their early series magic.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Indian think tank faces some delicious dilemmas. Will we see Jaiswal unleashed at the top, reshuffling the batting order? Samson&#39;s likely to don the gloves, adding his wealth of experience behind the stumps. And let&#39;s not forget Dube - a genuine game-changer with both bat and ball.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Zimbabwe, however, are grappling with consistency woes. The promising duo of Wessly Madhevere and Brian Bennett have shown glimpses of brilliance, but the hosts desperately need a collective effort to topple the Indian juggernaut. Their bowling unit, after being taken to the cleaners last time out, must channel the spirit of their opening match heroics.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Casting our minds back to the previous encounter, it was a masterclass from India. Abhishek Sharma and Ruturaj Gaikwad put on a batting clinic, their 137-run partnership forming the backbone of India&#39;s mammoth 234/2. Abhishek&#39;s scintillating century was the highlight, while Gaikwad&#39;s composed fifty provided the perfect foil.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Zimbabwe&#39;s reply, sadly, never got out of first gear.India&#39;s bowlers had a field day, with Mukesh Kumar and Avesh Khan landing the knockout blows, ably supported by the spin duo of Ravi Bishnoi and Washington Sundar.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>As we look ahead to this crucial fixture, India&#39;s reinforcements add an extra layer of intrigue. Will they stick with the winning combination or unleash their returning stars?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Who will seize the momentum in this seesaw battle? Will it be India&#39;s firepower or Zimbabwe&#39;s home advantage that proves decisive? The anticipation is palpable as we count down to what promises to be a humdinger at Harare Sports Club. Buckle up - we&#39;re in for a treat!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE:<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"> India Won the Toss and Elected to Bat&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/double-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Shubman Gill | India Captain: &quot;We will bat first. Looks like a good wicket, no moisture, so that&#39;s why.We have got three World Cup winners back in the team: Sanju Samson, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and Shivam Dube.

India, led by the dynamic Shubman Gill, secured a 23-run victory over Zimbabwe in the third match, taking a 2-1 lead in the series. Opting to bat first, India posted 182/4, thanks to Gill&#39;s stellar 66 off 49 balls and Ruturaj Gaikwad&#39;s explosive 49 off 28 balls. Yashasvi Jaiswal contributed 36 off 27 balls, with late cameo from Sanju Samson. Zimbabwe&#39;s bowlers Blessing Muzarabani and Sikandar Raza took 2 wickets each but faced resistance from the Indian batsmen. Chasing 183, Zimbabwe&#39;s top order crumbled to 39/5, but Dion Myers&#39; unbeaten 65 off 49 balls showed resilience. Clive Madande and Wellington Masakadza added support, but it was insufficient as they ended at 159/6. Washington Sundar starred with the ball, claiming 3 wickets for 15 runs, supported by Avesh Khan&#39;s 2 wickets and Khaleel Ahmed&#39;s economical spell. Key moments included Gill and Gaikwad&#39;s 72-run partnership and Sundar&#39;s crucial breakthroughs. India&#39;s comprehensive performance leaves Zimbabwe needing a strong comeback in the next match. Stay tuned as the series heats up!&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Sikandar Raza| Zimbabwe Captain:&quot;Yeah, I think it&#39;s our fielding again. We pride ourselves on our fielding, but the wheels have come off in the last few games. If we had fielded well, we would have been in the game. We also have issues at the top of the order that need fixing.Unfortunately, we&#39;ve tried 15 different opening pairs, but nothing has clicked. It&#39;s time for the players, myself included, to step up and take responsibility. I can understand mistakes from youngsters, but some of us have played over 40 T20Is, and we need to shoulder the responsibility.I&#39;m an option for the top order, but we also need some experience in the middle order. This is the best team we have, and we need to back them&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Player of the Match - Washington Sundar</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Washington Sundar :&quot;Feels amazing. To perform for the country is always special. Yes, it feels amazing. It was definitely a better wicket today. In the first two matches, there was something in it for the bowlers. Today, it was much better for batting. Zimbabwe did put a bit of pressure on us. That partnership between Myers and Madande put some pressure on us, but we are happy to go over the line. We have plenty of places to visit here in Zimbabwe. Hopefully, we finish the series on Saturday.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shubman Gill | India Captain:</strong></span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Feels good going 2-1 up in the series. It was a crucial game for us. Yeah, definitely, it looked like we would go over 200. It was not easy to hit the length ball, and that&#39;s what Ruturaj and I were discussing in the middle. That was the message we gave to our bowlers, and they executed it perfectly.</strong></span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Everyone is contributing, from the openers to the bowlers.

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>In the penultimate clash of the T20I series at Harare Sports Club, India looks to seal the series, leading 2-1 against Zimbabwe. After an unexpected hiccup in the opener, India bounced back with two emphatic victories, flexing their cricketing muscle and depth. The return of Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson, and Shivam Dube from the T20 World Cup squad has added firepower to the team. Skipper Shubman Gill has been a rock at the top, and the middle order has fired on all cylinders, making India a formidable opponent. In the last game, India posted a competitive 182/4, thanks to solid contributions from Gill, Jaiswal, and a brisk cameo by Samson. Despite being a bit of a circus in the field, Zimbabwe managed to recover from a dismal 39/5 to 159/6, with Dion Myers and Clive Madande putting on a brave 77-run stand. However, their performance still fell short, with glaring fielding and batting inconsistencies. As we gear up for the fourth T20I, Zimbabwe faces a must-win scenario. They must sharpen their fielding and deliver a cohesive performance to stay in the hunt. India, brimming with confidence, aims to wrap up the series. With a pitch likely to favour spinners, expect some fireworks. Will Zimbabwe level the series and keep the dream alive, or will India crush their hopes? Buckle up, fans, for an epic showdown!<br />\n<br />\nHead to Head :</strong><br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/BCCI(ICC 2024) Head to Head - 640px width (7)_1720865161.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>PITCH REPORT:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tino Mawoyo and Abhinav Mukund: &quot;Today&#39;s game will be played on a fresh pitch. During our inspection, we noticed that the groundsmen had watered it yesterday, which means there might be some early moisture to assist the pacers. The pitch retains a bit more grass than usual. One boundary is quite short, measuring in the 60s, while the opposite side is longer, around the 80s. Indian pacers, known for their skiddy nature, have been effective at hitting the good length. Conversely, Zimbabwe&#39;s taller bowlers can exploit fuller lengths and generate bounce. Spinners will also find some assistance. Although Zimbabwe has started to read Bishnoi and Sundar better as the series has progressed, there&rsquo;s still a lot of work ahead. This looks like the best pitch of the series so far.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>TOSS:</strong> <span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>INDIA WON THE TOSS AND ELECTED TO FIELD!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shubman Gill (India Captain):</strong></span> <span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We&#39;ve decided to bowl first. The pitch seems fresh and from what the groundsmen mentioned, it&rsquo;s been watered and should offer something for the fast bowlers. There are areas we need to improve, particularly in controlling the runs during the death overs. We got a bit complacent last time, so we&#39;ll be focusing on tightening up in that aspect. Tushar makes his debut.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Sikandar Raza (Zimbabwe Captain): &quot;Our plan was to bat first today. Although the pitch is fresh, it tends to slow down later on in this region, so batting first seemed ideal. We&#39;re building towards our vision for 2026, and it&#39;s fantastic to have India here giving our players valuable game time. I&#39;m hopeful our top three will make a strong start today. We need all three departments to perform well. If we can achieve that, we stand a good chance. After two tough games, I believe the team is eager and ready to bounce back.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Shubman Gill, continuing his winning streak at the toss, chose to bowl first on a fresh pitch. Tushar Deshpande, making his debut, and Khaleel Ahmed struggled initially with the new ball as Tadiwanashe Marumani and Wessly Madhevere forged a 63-run partnership for the first wicket. However, India&#39;s fifth and sixth bowlers, Abhishek Sharma and Shivam Dube, dismissed Marumani (32 off 31) and Madhevere (25 off 24) in consecutive overs, bringing India back into the contest. Zimbabwe lost momentum as wickets fell steadily. Nevertheless, skipper Sikandar Raza opted for an aggressive approach, scoring 46 off 28 balls, Once Raza was dismissed in the 19th over, India restricted Zimbabwe to 152/7 on a promising batting surface. Khaleel Ahmed rebounded effectively in the death overs, finishing with figures of 2/32. Tushar Deshpande claimed his first international wicket by dismissing the key player, Raza. Sundar, Abhishek, and Dube each took a wicket, while Bishnoi remained wicketless for the second game in a row. In response, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill launched a relentless assault on the Zimbabwean bowlers, forging an unbroken 156-run partnership. Jaiswal was the more aggressive, scoring 93 off 53 balls with 13 fours and 2 sixes. Gill, after a cautious start, found his rhythm and notched up his second consecutive fifty of the series, remaining unbeaten on 58 off 39 balls with 5 fours and 2 sixes. Zimbabwe&#39;s six bowlers were unable to break through and were thoroughly outplayed.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Sikandar Raza (Zimbabwe Captain): &quot;I believe the pitch was a bit on the slower side at the start, perhaps slightly damp. We aimed for a total around 160, which we thought would be competitive, but credit where it&#39;s due &ndash; their batting was exceptional today. Even 180 might not have been sufficient. Today, we must acknowledge that they outplayed us with the bat. We aim to come back stronger in the final game of the series. We need to improve in all three areas of the game. Even if we end the series at 2-3, it would still be a respectable outcome.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Yashasvi Jaiswal (Player of the Match): &quot;I thoroughly enjoyed today. The pitch was favourable, and I had specific plans for each bowler which made my batting experience enjoyable. When the ball was new, it came onto the bat nicely. But as it aged, it slowed down. I adjusted my approach accordingly. Shubman and I have great chemistry while batting together. Initially, I aimed to go hard in the first 10 overs, but after spending some time in the middle, I understood how to adapt and stay unbeaten till the end to secure the win for our team.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shubman Gill (India Captain): &quot;I&rsquo;m thrilled with my first series win as captain, but the job isn&rsquo;t finished yet. We still have one more game to play. Chasing was a key focus for us, and it&#39;s great to have accomplished that. This team is fantastic, a wonderful group of players. I hope we can continue to progress together. I haven&rsquo;t had a discussion with the coach about any changes yet, but if there are any, I&rsquo;ll update you at the toss.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

After a shocking loss in the series opener, the Shubman Gill-led Indian team has bounced back with a vengeance, winning the next three games to secure a 3-1 lead in the five-match series.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The latest victory was particularly emphatic, as India steamrolled Zimbabwe by 10 wickets, marking their dominance in the shortest format. Gill&#39;s impeccable record at the toss continued as he opted to bowl first in the fourth game. The Zimbabwean openers, Wessly Madhvere and Tadiwanashe Marumani, provided a sturdy start, but the middle order crumbled under pressure. Despite a valiant 46-run effort from Sikandar Raza, the hosts could only muster 152/7 in their 20 overs.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tushar Deshpande, playing his debut series, redeemed himself with the crucial wicket of Raza after a shaky start. Khaleel Ahmed shone in the death overs, claiming two wickets, while Abhishek Sharma and Shivam Dube also chipped in with vital breakthroughs. Washington Sundar continued his consistent performance, and despite going wicketless, Ravi Bishnoi made an impact with his fielding prowess.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India&#39;s chase was a masterclass in batting. Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill dismantled the Zimbabwean bowling attack with ease, guiding their team to victory in just 16 overs. Jaiswal&#39;s explosive 53-ball 93 and Gill&#39;s elegant 39-ball 58 ensured India reached the target without losing a wicket.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Looking ahead to the final game, India is expected to rotate their squad, possibly giving a chance to some new faces. The aim will be to finish the series on a high note with a 4-1 victory. Zimbabwe, on the other hand, will be playing for pride, hoping to salvage a win and end the series on a positive note.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Will India maintain their dominance, or can Zimbabwe pull off an upset in the final match?<br />\n<br />\nToss:- <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Zimbabwe have won the toss and opted to bowl first.<br />\n<br />\nSikandar Raza: &quot;We&#39;re going to bowl first. The pitch tends to improve, so it should be better for batting in the second innings. We have the motivation, confidence, and skills needed. Chatara has been rested for this match&quot;.</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Shubman Gill: &quot;We were planning to bat first anyway. Our spinners have performed well, and the fast bowlers have been economical. The players are hungry and eager to play. It&#39;s challenging to play back-to-back matches. We have a couple of changes today - Mukesh Kumar and Parag are coming in.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

Sanju Samson stepped up when it mattered most, scoring a composed 58 off 45 balls. He was well-supported by Riyan Parag and Shivam Dube, who contributed 22 and 26 runs respectively, propelling India to a strong total.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In response, Zimbabwe struggled against India&#39;s bowling attack. Mukesh Kumar was the standout performer, claiming four crucial wickets. Despite an important 34-run knock from Myers and a late cameo from Faraz Akram, Zimbabwe fell short, managing only 125 runs before being bowled out. Shivam Dube also chipped in with two key wickets, ensuring India&#39;s dominance throughout the match.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This comprehensive win not only secured the series for India but also showcased the depth and resilience of their squad<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Shivam Dube- Player of the Match: &quot;Contributing in both batting and bowling is always special. Taking wickets felt great. T20s can be challenging, but one good shot can turn things around. The ground here is big, and we love playing in this amazing atmosphere with such fantastic people.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nWashington Sundar- Player of the Series: &quot;It&#39;s great to finish with a win. After the first game, we noticed conditions were similar to South Africa, with extra bounce and pace. We had plenty of time to gather insights. There are many takeaways and learnings from this series, and I got to bowl a lot. Our team had a lot of success together.&quot;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Sikandar Raza: &quot;Blessing bowled excellently throughout the series. However, our batting fell short. What stands out for me is our fielding attitude, which we can improve. Richie wasn&rsquo;t fit at the beginning, so having him fit now is fantastic. It&#39;s great to see Richie and Blessing working well together. I need to manage my workload, so I&#39;ll head back to play domestic cricket. I&#39;m still available for Test matches, and I leave for the Hundred in a few days.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shubman Gill: &quot;It&rsquo;s been an excellent series. The hunger and determination we showed after the first loss were phenomenal. Many of the players had long flights and were not used to the conditions, but their adaptation was remarkable. I&#39;ve been to Sri Lanka once for the Asia Cup, and I&#39;m looking forward to going there again and performing well&quot;.</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

However, they will start this series with a new captain and coach, Surya Kumar Yadav and Gautam Gambhir, respectively. With veterans Kohli, Rohit, and Jadeja bidding farewell to the format, the onus now falls on Pant, Hardik, and Surya to lead the charge. These players have a knack for winning matches and will be eager to carry their form forward. Bumrah has been rested for the series to manage his workload.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Sri Lanka, on the other hand, come into the series after a disappointing T20 World Cup. They, too, have&nbsp;undergone changes in</strong>&nbsp;<strong>coaching and captaincy. Sanath Jayasuriya will serve as their interim coach, while the cool-headed Asalanka, who recently led Jaffna to a title triumph, is set to captain the team. Sri Lanka has added the experienced Chandimal and Perera to their squad for this series and will be looking to start on a positive note.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>With both teams featuring new-look squads and the stakes sky-high, which team will emerge on top?

The surface is hard with some visible cracks.<br />\nCompared to the LPL surface, this one looks quite different, with more cracks.

You can look forward to more wins and consistent performances from our team.&quot;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Suryakumar Yadav:-&quot;The pitch looks good, so we&#39;re fine with batting first. Our brand of cricket remains unchanged. The relationship between me and Gambhir has been special for many years. Dube, Samson, Khaleel, and Washington are the four players missing out today.

Pathirana was the standout bowler for Sri Lanka, claiming four wickets.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In response, Sri Lanka began their chase with confidence as Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Mendis put together an 84-run opening stand. Mendis fell for a well-made 45, but Nissanka continued to anchor the innings, partnering with Perera to add another 50 runs. However, once Nissanka was dismissed, the Indian bowlers seized control.

Despite losing wickets, they maintained a high tempo. We had practiced here for two to three days and were well-prepared for the pitch conditions. Given that we recently won the World Cup, we never doubted our ability to stay in control. Fortunately, there was no dew to contend with&quot;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000cc\">Charitha Asalanka (Sri Lanka Skipper): &quot;Certainly, we weren&#39;t up to the mark with the ball during the powerplay. However, we made a strong comeback, and at one point, it seemed they might reach 240. We could have performed better with the bat. The 6-5 combination is an experiment, but it&#39;s the approach we should consider for the future.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

Sri Lanka batting first, got off to a great start, with Pathum Nissanka&#39;s 32 and Kusal Perera&#39;s blistering 53 off 34 balls providing a strong foundation, after which Ravi Bishnoi shone with the ball for India claiming 3/26, supported by Axar Patel, Arshdeep Singh and Hardik Pandya, who each took two wickets to pull back the momentum and restrict Sri Lanka to 161/9.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Chasing a revised target of 78 runs in 8 overs, India came out with all guns blazing.

The Indian team has been in stupendous form with both bat and ball. Jaiswal&#39;s explosive starts and Suryakumar Yadav&#39;s versatile batting have been highlights, while Ravi Bishnoi has stood out as the leading bowler, ably supported by Arshdeep Singh and Riyan Parag. This first series under the combination of Gautam Gambhir and Suryakumar Yadav has already been a success, and they will be looking to end the series on a high note.</strong><br />\n<strong>Sri Lanka, on the other hand, have struggled throughout the series, particularly their middle order, which collapsed significantly&mdash;losing nine wickets for 30 runs in the first game and seven wickets for 31 runs in the second game. However, their top order has been impressive, spearheaded by Nissanka&#39;s magnificent performances. Kusal Perera and Mendis have also shown good form with the bat. Pathirana has successfully dismissed Suryakumar Yadav in both games, and Hasaranga has taken Jaiswal&#39;s wicket in both matches. They will be keen to replicate their performances once again. Sri Lanka will be looking to change their middle-order fortunes and will eye a consolation win to end the series on a positive note.<br />\n<br />\nHead-To-Head in T20Is:<br />\nIn the 31 games played between the two teams, India has emerged Victorious on 21 occasions while Sri Lanka has managed to win nine games.

We&#39;re on a new pitch right next to the one used in the last two games. This surface is drier, with visible cracks, so expect a significant turn. Slower deliveries will be particularly effective here.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>There&#39;s dew on the ground, making the ball wet and causing it to slide. As a result, chasing might be the preferable option. A target of 160-170 should be competitive. The slower you bowl, the more difficult it will be for batters to play their strokes. The dew will also make it challenging to grip the ball properly.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nToss:- Sri Lanka has won the toss and opted to bowl first.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000cc\">Charith Asalanka:&nbsp;&quot;We are going to bowl first. The pitch looks dry. There was a batting collapse when the ball got older, making it harder to bat. We&#39;ve planned a bit differently this time. We have one change in the lineup, Wickramasinghe comes in for Dasun.&quot;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Suryakumar Yadav:&nbsp;&quot;We would&#39;ve liked to chase as well, considering the weather. It becomes difficult for the bowling team to control the ball later. We have four players resting today - Hardik, Axar, Rishabh, and Arshdeep. We talked about the brand of cricket we want to play, and it&#39;s about improving every game and being the best version of ourselves.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

Both teams scored 137 in their allotted 20 overs, leading to the dramatic finish.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India, batting first, posted a total of 137/9. Despite early setbacks, Shubman Gill (39 off 37) and Riyan Parag (26 off 18) provided some stability. The standout bowler for Sri Lanka was Maheesh Theekshana, who took 3 wickets for 28 runs. Chamindu Wickramasinghe and Wanindu Hasaranga also contributed significantly, each taking crucial wickets to keep the Indian batting lineup in check.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sri Lanka&#39;s chase saw a solid start from Kusal Mendis (43 off 41) and Kusal Perera (46 off 34), but they struggled to maintain momentum, losing wickets at critical junctures. Ravi Bishnoi and Washington Sundar were the pick of the Indian bowlers, each claiming two wickets to keep the pressure on while Rinku and Surya too contributed with two wickets. The match eventually ended in a tie, with Sri Lanka finishing at 137/8.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In the super over, India&#39;s bowlers held their nerve to secure a thrilling victory, sealing the series. This win marked a significant achievement for Suryakumar Yadav&#39;s leadership and highlighted the depth and resilience of the Indian team.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Washington Sundar | Player of the Match:<br />\n&quot;All the work I&#39;ve put in, along with blessings from God, really helped me today. I tried to stay calm throughout. I&#39;m very grateful to SKY for trusting me with the ball. It&#39;s a wonderful opportunity, and I just focused on doing what I&#39;m supposed to do. We did our homework on their batters, and I aimed to hit the right lengths.&quot;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000cc\">Charith Asalanka:&nbsp;<br />\n&quot;I am really disappointed with our batting lineup, especially the middle-order and lower middle-order. The poor shot selection was a major issue. Hasaranga was sent up the order because the spinners were bowling, and he had the license to hit a few boundaries, but it didn&#39;t work out. We made wrong shot selections on this pitch. The target was definitely achievable, and we need to perform better as professional cricketers. I want to see improved batting performances in the ODIs. Our top three and four have done well, which is the only positive for us.&quot;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Suryakumar Yadav | Player of the Series:<br />\n&quot;More than the last over, I feel the real turning point was when we were 30/4. The boys showed incredible character to reach 140, which was a par score on that track. I told them that if we put our hearts into it, we could pull it off. Their skill level and self-confidence make my job easy. The positivity and care they have for each other are unbelievable. After the last game, I told a few boys they would be rested, and they were ready to sit out without hesitation. They make my job easy, and I feel little pressure when I bat. As I said before the series, I don&#39;t want to just be a captain; I want to be a leader.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

Fresh off a 3-0 T20I sweep, the Men in Blue are ready to light up the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>With the return of heavyweights like Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, and Shreyas Iyer, India&rsquo;s lineup looks formidable. The top order, featuring Rohit and Shubman Gill, promises fireworks, while the middle order, bolstered by Iyer and Rahul, adds depth and stability. Keep an eye out for the potential debut of Riyan Parag, adding a fresh spark to the mix.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The bowling attack remains strong, with Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav leading the charge, and Harshit Rana poised for his maiden ODI appearance. Despite the gloomy weather forecast and a 78% chance of rain, the anticipation is palpable.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sri Lanka, battling injury woes, will rely on the likes of Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Mendis to step up. But make no mistake, the spotlight is firmly on India as they aim to continue their dominance and fine-tune their squad ahead of the Champions Trophy.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Head to Head</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/BCCI(ICC 2024) Head to Head - 640px width (1)_1722589120.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

My goal was to put their bowlers under pressure. Janith and I aimed to build a partnership, and later, I had a solid partnership with Hasaranga. The wicket was slow, so we targeted a score of 220. The pitch improved slightly in the second innings. Our skipper Wanindu Hasaranga changed the game for us.

We batted well in patches but lacked consistent momentum. We had the upper hand, but then we lost a couple of wickets. The partnership between KL and Axar brought us back into the game. It was a bit disappointing at the end, but these things happen. Sri Lanka played well, and in the end, it was a fair result. The pitch remained the same; it wasn&#39;t one where you could just come in and play your shots&mdash;you had to dig in. The game swung back and forth between both teams. We should have managed to get that one run.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Charith Asalanka, Sri Lanka Skipper: &quot;I did believe we could defend the total; we should have done a bit better to restrict them. The pitch turned more in the afternoon, but under lights, batting became easier. When the left-hander came in, I felt I could bowl as it was spinning a lot. I&#39;m happy with the energy we showed in the field. Dunith&#39;s knock was crucial, and Nissanka batted well.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Following an exhilarating opener in the ODI series, we are back for the second match between India and Sri Lanka. The venue remains unchanged, but the hosts will be missing their star player, Wanindu Hasaranga, due to a hamstring injury from the previous game. The Indian team, which dominated much of the first match, aims to rectify their past errors. Meanwhile, the spirited Sri Lankan side seeks to maintain the momentum they gained in the latter stages of the first ODI.&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/double-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#660000\"><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nRussell Arnold: &quot;It&#39;s a scorching afternoon, and the warm breeze adds to the heat. We&#39;ve shifted a few strips over, and the pitch looks dry, much like the one from a couple of days ago. The cracks on the surface are quite wide, indicating significant crumbling as the game progresses. The captain who wins the toss will likely choose to bat first. Batters will need to focus on finding the gaps and running hard to wear down the opposition.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Sri Lanka has won the toss and has elected to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> first</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Charith Asalanka, Sri Lanka Skipper: &quot;Definitely we are batting first. The pitch appears similar to the previous match with minimal changes. Our strategy remains unchanged from the last game. Wanindu Hasaranga and Mohamed Shiraz are out, replaced by Kamindu Mendis and Jeffrey Vandersay. The previous game gave us a boost, and now we need to capitalize on that and secure a win.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Skipper: &nbsp;&quot;We understand what&#39;s required when chasing, so we&#39;ve talked to the team about it. You can&#39;t always approach the game with the same mindset; you need to adjust to the conditions at hand. We&#39;ve emphasized this to the boys. It&#39;s crucial to adapt quickly and play with freedom. Staying focused on the present and what needs to be done today is important. We&#39;re going with the same XI. As for the tie, it wasn&#39;t a blow to morale. Analyzing the game, both teams dominated at different stages, making it a fair outcome in the end.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Jeffrey Vandersay starred with the ball for Sri Lanka, taking 6 wickets for 36 runs, while Charith Asalanka chipped in with 3 wickets.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Jeffrey Vandersay is Player of the Match&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/double-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /></strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Jeffrey Vandersay: &quot;There was a lot of pressure coming into the side, especially after a layoff. While it&#39;s easy to take credit for my performance, I want to acknowledge the batters who scored 240 runs, making it easier for me to bowl in good areas. With Hasaranga, our No. 1 spinner, out, I had to adapt to the team&#39;s atmosphere and balance quickly. I need to keep pushing myself to perform well.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Skipper: &nbsp;&quot;Losing a game is always painful; it&#39;s not just about those 10 overs. Consistency is key, and we didn&#39;t manage that today. While it&#39;s disappointing, these things happen. We need to adapt to the conditions in front of us. With a left-right combination, we thought it would be easier to rotate the strike&mdash;credit to Jeffrey Vandersay for his impressive six-wicket haul. </strong></span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Don&#39;t want to look too much into how we played. But there&#39;ll be talks about&nbsp;our batting in the middle overs&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Charith Asalanka, Sri Lanka Skipper: &quot;I was quite satisfied with our score of 240, which I felt was sufficient. As a captain, having an abundance of spin options is a good problem to have. Vandersay delivered an unbelievable spell, especially considering the opposition was over 90 runs when he started bowling. My primary role is as a batter, so I focus on scoring runs first, and then I can contribute with my bowling.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

The first match ended in a dramatic tie, while the second match saw Sri Lanka emerging victorious.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Today&#39;s match is crucial, with everyone wondering: Will India level the series with a win, or will Sri Lanka secure a trophy for their cabinet? Another point of interest is India&#39;s playing XI - will there be any changes, or will they stick with the same team?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Stay tuned as we dive into this thrilling encounter.</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Head to Head :</strong><br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/BCCI(ICC 2024) Head to Head - 640px width (11)_1723018850.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>One match ended in a tie between the two nations.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nRussell Arnold: &quot;The pitch is dry once again, setting the stage for a similar type of game. However, it&rsquo;s a fresh pitch, with the groundsman meticulously using scissors to remove grass. This has resulted in more visible cracks, promising not just a turn but also the occasional spiteful bounce. This will certainly present a greater challenge for the batters. To score runs here, one must adopt a patient and disciplined approach. As Robbie mentioned, you&rsquo;ve got to be boring to get runs here.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:<br />\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12\">Sri Lanka has won the toss and has elected to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> first</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#f39c12\">Charith Asalanka, Sri Lanka Skipper: &quot; Definitely We are going to bat first.

It&#39;s clear what we need to do with both the bat and the ball. We&#39;ve addressed it as a group. You have to give credit to the opposition; they played well and understood the situation perfectly. This is another opportunity for us to correct our course.

Everyone is supporting each other, and I am excited to be part of this team.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Skipper: &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a major concern, but it&#39;s something we need to address individually and within our game plan. It&#39;s a joke to think that playing for India allows any room for complacency. When I am captain, complacency is not an option. However, you have to give credit where it&#39;s due&mdash;Sri Lanka played better than us today. We assessed the conditions and chose our combinations accordingly. Some players needed to be considered, hence the changes. We have many areas that need improvement, rather than just focusing on the positives.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Charith Asalanka, Sri Lanka Skipper: &quot; I am a happy captain right now. The team did everything right throughout the series. We all knew India had a strong batting lineup, so we focused on our strength, which is spin, and we backed it fully. The team is in high spirits, and our coach, Sanath Jayasuriya, has been very active and supportive. The boys have really enjoyed the team environment.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>The Indian cricket team is gearing up for an intense and exciting three-month Test season, beginning with a two-match series against Bangladesh, starting on September 19, 2024, at the iconic MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. This season promises to be a grueling one for India, as they will play a total of 10 Test matches&mdash;five at home and five away. After facing Bangladesh, India will take on New Zealand in another home series, followed by a crucial five-match series against Australia down under in November and December.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bangladesh enters this contest with immense confidence, having just completed a historic series win against Pakistan on their home soil. This victory marks Bangladesh&#39;s third away Test series triumph, and it has come at a crucial time when they are still in contention for a spot in the World Test Championship (WTC) final.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>The standout performers for Bangladesh in the Pakistan series were Litton Das and Mehidy Hasan Miraz, both of whom played pivotal roles while Mushfiqur Rahim&#39;s 191 in the first Tests was their key to victory. In a thrilling comeback during the second Test, Bangladesh was reduced to 26/6 in their first innings, trailing by more than 200 runs. However, Litton and Mehidy stitched together a record-breaking seventh-wicket partnership that turned the game around, ultimately leading Bangladesh to a convincing six-wicket victory.</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Mehidy Hasan&rsquo;s heroics were not limited to his batting. With the ball, he claimed 10 wickets across the two games, making him the leading wicket-taker in the series for Bangladesh. He was closely followed by Hasan Mahmud, who took 8 wickets, and the young pace sensation Nahid Rana, who grabbed 6 wickets. Bangladesh&rsquo;s bowling attack, spearheaded by these players, will aim to carry this winning momentum into the series against India, with the WTC final spot still very much within reach.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>India, on the other hand, returns to the international arena after a considerable break. The last time they played was in early August, and they will be keen to get back into the groove with a fresh start. India currently sits at the top of the WTC points table with 68.52 PCT in nine matches so far and has the most remaining matches (10) to play. With the stakes high, they are aiming to consolidate their position and make a strong case for the WTC final yet again.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>The pitch at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, known for assisting spinners, will likely see India fielding a spin-heavy attack. The combination of local hero Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja will form the crux of India&rsquo;s bowling attack, supported by a third spinner. India may also go with two pacers to maintain a balanced lineup, with the possibility of including one of their young fast-bowling talents. The Chepauk wicket, traditionally known for its turn and variable bounce, will test both teams&rsquo; batting skills against high-quality spin.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>India&rsquo;s squad is a blend of experience and youth, and the team management will likely rely on their seasoned players to lead the charge. With senior players such as Ashwin and Jadeja handling the spin department, and experienced batters like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma in the middle, India will look to dominate Bangladesh from the outset.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>A Battle with High Stakes</strong></p>\n\n<p>With both teams eyeing the WTC final, this series promises to be a fascinating contest. Bangladesh is riding high on their recent success and will be hungry to challenge the top-ranked side. For India, this is the beginning of a crucial season, and they will aim to start it on a high note, especially with a challenging tour of Australia looming later in the year.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Head-To-Head in Tests:</strong><br />\n<br />\nIn the 13 games contested between the two teams, India have clearly dominated the contest with 11 wins while other two games has been ended in a draw. Bangladesh are yet to open their win account against India so far.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/BCCI(ICC 2024) Head to Head - 640px width (4)_1726659557.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Stats At MA Chidambaram Stadium.</strong><br />\n<br />\nIn the 34 matches played at this venue, teams batting first have won 12 times, while teams batting second have emerged victorious on 10 occasions. Eleven matches have ended in a draw, and one game resulted in a tie. Spinners have dominated at Chepauk, taking 584 wickets, while pacers have managed 381 wickets. Interestingly, only two Indian batters have scored triple centuries in Tests, and both of these remarkable feats were achieved at this ground. Notably, Virender Sehwag also has another triple century to his name, which he scored in Multan.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/BCCI( ICC 2024) Stats Temp (7)_1726661950.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Pitch Report: Dinesh Karthik:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>This surface, reminiscent of the ones that saw Bedi and Prasanna weave their magic, hints at bounce and turn.

In the first innings, India posted a total of 376 runs, with significant contributions from Ravindra Jadeja (86), R. Ashwin (113), and Yashasvi Jaiswal (56). Bangladesh&#39;s bowling was led by Hasan Mahmud, who took 5 wickets. Bangladesh struggled in their first innings, being bowled out for 149, with Shakib (32) and Litton Das (22) being the top scorers. Jasprit Bumrah claimed 4 wickets, while Akash Deep, Siraj, and Ravindra Jadeja contributed with two each.</p>\n\n<p>In the second innings, India declared at 287/4, with Shubman Gill&#39;s exceptional 119* and Pant&rsquo;s quick 109 playing a key role. Chasing a daunting target, Bangladesh put up a slightly better fight in their second innings, managing 234, with skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto scoring 82 to lead the charge. However, Ashwin&#39;s 5-wicket haul ensured Bangladesh&rsquo;s defeat, sealing the match in India&rsquo;s favour by a comprehensive margin of 280 runs.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#16a085\">Najmul Hossain Shanto, Bangladesh Skipper: &quot; Would like to concentrate on the positives.&nbsp; Commendable bowling efforts from Hasan Mahmud, Taskin Ahmed, and Nahid Rana in the first innings. India batted well and their seamers contributed, especially with the new ball. Like we bowled in the first innings, We need momentum and keep delivering such performances consistently.

Even though we&#39;ve been away from playing for a while, you&#39;re never truly away from cricket. We arrived a week in advance, aiming for the result we wanted. Pant has been terrific. He&rsquo;s gone through some tough phases, and the way he handled himself was incredible to watch. After returning in the IPL, followed by a strong World Cup, he&rsquo;s back in his favorite format. The key was to give him enough game time, and credit to him, he made an immediate impact. Regardless of conditions, we aim to build our team around that approach. Over the past few years, wherever we&rsquo;ve played, we&rsquo;ve ensured we had this as part of our strategy. Full credit to the players for stepping up when needed. The red-soil pitch always presents something unique, requiring patience. This was a surface where we needed to be patient with both bat and ball to keep them under pressure. Ash has been there throughout. He&rsquo;s consistently reliable with both the ball and bat. Every time he&rsquo;s involved, it&rsquo;s a joy to watch&mdash;he&rsquo;s never out of the game. He also enjoyed his time batting in the TNPL.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>R ASHWIN is Player of the Match&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/double-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /></strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>R ASHWIN: &quot;Every time I play in Chennai, it&rsquo;s an incredible experience for me. I&rsquo;ve spent so many hours in those stands watching Test cricket and international matches. I&rsquo;m probably enjoying my game now because of what I&rsquo;m doing on the field. It was a chance to fight hard and dig deep. I kept things simple and I&rsquo;m grateful to Jadeja for his support. It was a special innings, though it didn&rsquo;t really hit me until the second day. My main job is bowling&mdash;that&rsquo;s how I make a living. Batting, on the other hand, just comes naturally to me..&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

With India holding a 1-0 lead after a commanding 280-run victory in Chennai, the hosts are eyeing a clean sweep while Bangladesh desperately seeks to level the series. However, the weather might play spoilsport, with rain forecast for the opening days, adding an element of unpredictability to the contest.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The pitch at Kanpur, traditionally a balanced surface, could throw a curveball this time.This uncertainty, coupled with the weather, has both teams on edge as they finalize their strategies. India, buoyed by their depth in Chennai despite quiet outings from Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, might bolster their spin attack by bringing in Axar Patel or Kuldeep Yadav.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>As the teams take the field, all eyes will be on key battles: India&#39;s top order against Bangladesh&#39;s new ball attack, and Bangladesh&#39;s batsmen facing India&#39;s potent spin trio. While India enters as firm favorites, Bangladesh are eager to prove their mettle. With World Test Championship points at stake, this match promises to be a gripping contest, provided the weather permits.</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Head-To-Head in Tests:</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>In as many as 14 games battled between the two teams, India has won 12 games while Bangladesh are yet to open their win account.

There&rsquo;s a bit of grass on the surface, which could help us.There were plenty of positives from the first Test. Although we didn&rsquo;t start well with the bat, we recovered strongly, posted a competitive total, and our bowlers did their part. In the second innings, we batted even better and set a challenging target. Our bowlers once again rose to the occasion.I expect this match to be no different in terms of competitiveness.

As a batter, it&#39;s crucial to convert starts into big scores. The encouraging thing is that most of us got off to good starts in the last game. Hopefully, we can post a solid total today.The pitch looks good for batting.

The win, achieved with more than a session to spare, seemed improbable after nearly three days were lost to rain and wet outfield conditions.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The match began with India winning the toss and electing to field, a rare choice for the team in home Tests. Bangladesh&#39;s first innings, interrupted by weather delays, saw Mominul Haque as the standout performer with an unbeaten century. However, his efforts were not enough to prevent the visitors from being dismissed for 233, with Jasprit Bumrah leading India&#39;s bowling attack.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India&#39;s response was nothing short of extraordinary. The hosts adopted an aggressive T20-style approach in their first innings, breaking records for the fastest team totals at various stages. Rohit Sharma set the tone with three sixes as his first scoring shots, while Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul contributed quick half-centuries. India declared at 285/9 in just 34.4 overs, establishing a 52-run lead.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Bangladesh&#39;s second innings crumbled under pressure from India&#39;s formidable bowling lineup. Despite resistance from Shadman Islam and Mushfiqur Rahim, the visitors were bundled out for 146. Ravindra Jadeja, Jasprit Bumrah, and Ravichandran Ashwin shared the spoils, each claiming three wickets.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Chasing a modest target of 95, India lost early wickets but remained in control. Yashasvi Jaiswal once again showcased his aggressive intent, scoring a brisk 51 off 45 balls. Fittingly, Rishabh Pant hit the winning boundary, sealing India&#39;s victory.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This win solidifies India&#39;s position at the top of the World Test Championship standings and marks a successful start to Gautam Gambhir&#39;s tenure as coach. The team&#39;s ability to force a result in such time-constrained circumstances highlights their dominance in home conditions and their commitment to pursuing victory against all odds.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The match will be remembered for India&#39;s bold strategy and execution, turning what could have been a dull draw into a thrilling contest.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Yashasvi Jaiswal (Player of the Match):</span><br />\n&quot;I was just focused on what I could do for the team. The conditions in Chennai and here were different, so I adapted accordingly and gave my best. Every innings is important, and I always prepare with that mindset. Rohit bhai and Gautam sir told me to bat freely, and that&rsquo;s exactly what we aimed for&mdash;to win and play with intent.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#27ae60\">Najmul Hossain Shanto (Bangladesh Captain):</span><br />\n&quot;We took early wickets but couldn&rsquo;t capitalize later. In both matches, we didn&#39;t bat well according to the conditions. Our batters got starts but didn&rsquo;t convert. Mominul&#39;s innings and Miraz&rsquo;s bowling were positives, and I hope Miraz can continue this form in future matches.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rohit Sharma (India Captain):</span><br />\n&quot;In life, we all move on. Rahul Bhai did a great job, and now we&rsquo;re working with Gambhir, who has a clear mindset. It&rsquo;s early, but we&rsquo;ve started well. Losing a couple of days meant we had to keep the game moving. After getting them out for 233, it wasn&rsquo;t about runs but how many overs we could bowl at them. The pitch didn&rsquo;t offer much, but the bowlers made it happen.We took a calculated risk by batting aggressively, even knowing we might get bowled out quickly. Akash Deep has the fitness and energy to bowl long spells, and it&#39;s important to have players ready when needed.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

The series marks the international debut for IPL stars Mayank Yadav and Harshit Rana, while Sanju Samson gets a new role as opener alongside Abhishek Sharma. With regular players rested, this series offers a golden opportunity for India&#39;s next generation to shine on the big stage.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Bangladesh, still recovering from their Test series loss, brings experience to the table despite missing Shakib Al Hasan. Led by Najmul Hossain Shanto, the visitors will rely on the skills of Mustafizur Rahman and Mehidy Hasan to challenge India&#39;s dominance in T20Is, where the hosts hold a commanding 13-1 head-to-head record. As both teams face off on Gwalior&#39;s new pitch, fans can expect an entertaining clash between India&#39;s youthful energy and Bangladesh&#39;s seasoned performers, making this series opener a must-watch event.</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div>\n<p><strong>Pitch Report | Abhinav Mukund:<br />\n&quot;The square boundaries measure 64 and 65 meters, typical of Indian grounds with black soil pitches. Although the grass looks dry, the pitch appears firm, offering the potential for runs. This being the first international game at this venue, local T20 matches here have seen plenty of runs, with teams chasing winning 8 out of 12 times. The team winning the toss will likely choose to field, given these conditions.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS UPDATE: India Won the Toss and Elected to Field First&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Suryakumar Yadav | India Captain:<br />\n&quot;We&#39;ll bowl first. It feels a bit humid, but I don&#39;t expect much change in conditions. It&#39;s great to be back in India, and there&#39;s a lot of talent in this group. The guys are eager to learn and perform. The crowd looks fantastic, and the pitch seems good too, so we&#39;re excited to get going. A few players deserve their opportunities today. Tilak Varma, Ravi Bishnoi, and Harshit Rana will miss out.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Najmul Hossain Shanto | Bangladesh Captain:<br />\n&quot;We&#39;re fielding a fresh side with some new faces coming in for the T20Is. The pitch looks fresh, and while I would&#39;ve liked to bowl first too, I hope our openers can set the tone. We&#39;re going with three seamers, two spinners, and a lineup of six batters.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n",

Arshdeep Singh and Varun Chakravarthy, both snaring 3 wickets apiece, spun a web so complex even Spider-Man would be jealous! The Tigers could only muster a meagre 127, with Mehidy Hasan Miraz&#39;s 35 being the lone bright spot.<br />\nBut the real fireworks came in India&#39;s chase. It wasn&#39;t a chase, it was a demolition! Suryakumar Yadav&#39;s 29 off 14 set the tone, but it was Hardik Pandya who stole the show with a blistering 39 off 16. The target? Hunted down in just 11.5 overs!&nbsp;India romped home with 49 balls to spare, leaving Bangladesh scratching their heads. If this is a sign of things to come, buckle up folks, we&#39;re in for a rollercoaster ride in this series!&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Najmul Hossain Shanto | Bangladesh Captain:<br />\n&quot;Yes, obviously, we didn&rsquo;t start well at all. In T20Is, the first six overs are crucial, and we struggled with our batting. The plan was to play positively from the start, and show intent, but sometimes we need to mix that with sensible cricket. We didn&rsquo;t plan well in that regard, and it&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ll need to address in our team meeting. I feel we didn&rsquo;t post enough runs. Rishad and Mustafizur bowled well, but unfortunately, we just didn&rsquo;t put enough runs on the board to defend.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Suryakumar Yadav | India Captain:<br />\n&quot;We just focused on backing our skills, and what we discussed in the team meeting worked out well. That was the key. Absolutely, the way everyone showed character on the field was really promising. Every player stepped up, which made a big difference. It was pretty exciting to see them(Mayank Yadav and Nitish Reddy) perform. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to watching them excel in the upcoming games. Honestly, it&#39;s a good problem to have as captain because at times I found it tough to decide whom to bowl, but every time I handed over the ball, the bowlers delivered. I&rsquo;m really happy with how it went.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Arshdeep Singh | Player of the Match:<br />\n&quot;There was some breeze from the end I was bowling, so I thought I&rsquo;d use that to my advantage. I&rsquo;m enjoying my cricket right now. I&rsquo;ve made a few small adjustments in my run-up and wrist position, just trying to get better with every game. Experience plays a big part&mdash;the more you play, the better you understand the game. I loved the way everyone bowled today, especially Mayank. He was impressive.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div id=\"promptbox_extension_root\">&nbsp;</div>\n",

Team India, riding high on the back of a <em>thrashing</em> win in the first game, will be brimming with confidence. Their chase of a modest 128 was nothing short of a <em>masterclass</em>, finishing the job with 49 balls to spare. Fans were treated to some <em>scintillating</em> shots from the flamboyant Suryakumar Yadav, while Sanju Samson&rsquo;s calm brilliance and Hardik Pandya&rsquo;s <em>blistering</em> finish had Indian supporters roaring with joy.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>But before the fireworks with the bat, it was the Indian bowlers who <em>lit up</em> the stage. Varun Chakaravarthy, returning to the fold, was <em>on fire</em> with a sensational three-wicket haul. Arshdeep Singh matched his intensity, also grabbing three crucial wickets, while debutant Mayank Yadav&rsquo;s <em>fearsome</em> spell left Bangladesh reeling.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Bangladesh, however, will be itching for <em>revenge</em>. Their performance in the first game left fans disappointed, with only Mehidy Hasan&rsquo;s fighting 35* and Najmul Hossain Shanto&rsquo;s 27 standing out. Their bowlers were left clueless against India&rsquo;s <em>onslaught</em>. But a <em>comeback</em> is on the cards, as they&rsquo;ll be looking to pull off an upset and keep the series alive before heading to Hyderabad for the third T20I.&nbsp;Who among the two will come on top?<br />\n<br />\nHead-To-Head in T20Is:</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/BCCI(ICC 2024) Head to Head - 640px width_1728474578.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Stats at Arun Jaitley Stadium (Last five games)</strong><br />\n<br />\nIn the last five games played here at this venue, the team batting first has won all five games, while the average first-batting score is 235. This is a batting paradise, and the team winning the toss will opt to bat first. It&#39;s a high-scoring affair on the cards.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Pitch Report: Abinav Mukund</strong><br />\n<br />\n&quot;The second T20 International is shaping up to be a high-scoring affair. Historically, this pitch has seen plenty of runs. It&#39;s not a particularly large ground - around 55-60m square and 70m straight. During the IPL, this pitch has consistently produced scores over 200. The surface looks hard, which could spell trouble for bowlers. We might even see scores above 200 prove insufficient. In a recent local T20 tournament, a team scored 300 runs here. Interestingly, teams batting first have a perfect record in IPL matches at this venue. While batting first seems advantageous, the presence of dew could be a factor to consider.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Toss</strong>: Bangladesh has won the toss and elected to field!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Najmul Hossain Shanto:-<br />\n&quot;We would prefer to bowl first. There&#39;s a chance of dew in the second innings. The pitch looks good for batting, with high scores in previous matches. We need to focus on our strengths today. Our top order must perform well in the powerplay. We&#39;ve made one change: Sakib is replacing Shoriful in the lineup.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Suryakumar Yadav:-&nbsp;<br />\n&quot;We wanted to bat first too. It&#39;s a chance to test our bowlers with a potentially wet ball. There&#39;s plenty of talent in the team. I&#39;m enjoying watching our batters perform. You need to stay ahead of the game. The pitch looks great. We&#39;re going with the same lineup as last time.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Put into bat first on Delhi&#39;s batting-friendly pitch, India posted a formidable 221/9 in their 20 overs. Nitish Reddy and Rinku Singh were the standout performers, each scoring crucial half-centuries, while Hardik Pandya provided the finishing touch with some powerful hitting at the death.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Chasing a challenging target of 222, Bangladesh struggled to build any momentum, regularly losing wickets throughout the innings. They eventually finished at 135/9, with Mahmudullah top-scoring with 41. For India, Nitish Reddy and CV Varun picked up two wickets each, while the rest of the bowling attack chipped in with a wicket apiece, sealing the comprehensive win and the series victory for India.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#27ae60\">Najmul Hossain Shanto- Bangladesh Skipper<br />\n&quot;We repeated our mistakes from the previous game, which isn&#39;t acceptable for our team. We must improve. Bowling first was the right call, I believe. Their batting picked up after the powerplay, and we struggled to stick to our plans. As batsmen, we need to step up and have more self-belief. Our bowlers performed well, but we couldn&#39;t break through in the middle overs.&quot;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Suryakumar Yadav -India Skipper<br />\n&quot;I welcomed that scenario, wanting our middle-order batsmen in that position. I&#39;m pleased with both Rinku and Nitish. They played exactly as I&#39;d hoped. It&#39;s about going out there and expressing yourself. Only the jersey changes, everything else stays the same. I was keen to see how different bowlers would handle various situations.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nNitish Kumar Reddy - Player Of The Match<br />\n&quot;It&#39;s an incredible feeling to play for India. I&#39;m proud and grateful for this opportunity. Credit goes to the captain and coach for their support. They gave me the freedom to play my game. I started cautiously, but after that no-ball, things went my way.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

It&#39;s like a cricket version of &quot;India&#39;s Got Talent,&quot; and boy, have we uncovered some gems!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Take Nitish Kumar Reddy, for instance. This lad didn&#39;t just debut; he exploded onto the scene like a bat-wielding firecracker in Delhi. And let&#39;s not forget Rinku Singh, the ultimate supporting actor who&#39;s threatening to steal the show.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Together, they propelled India to a massive 221/9 in the second match, leaving Bangladesh&#39;s bowlers feeling like they&#39;d been caught in a batting blitzkrieg. Poor Taskin Ahmed and Mustafizur Rahman &ndash; they flashed moments of brilliance, but mostly looked like they were trying to stop a runaway train with a cricket bat.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Now, as we head into the Hyderabad humdinger, the pitch promises more fireworks than Diwali. With a par score of 171, we might need to install a scoreboard with extra digits!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sure, there&#39;s a whiff of rain in the air, but nothing can dampen Team India&#39;s spirits.So, will it be a hat-trick of wins for India? Or will Bangladesh find their roar in the eleventh hour?&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India Won the Toss and Elect to Bat First&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Suryakumar Yadav | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We&#39;ve decided to bat first. The wicket looks good, and with the dew factor in mind, we want to challenge ourselves. It&#39;s fantastic to see so many supporters here, even with us leading 2-0.Maintaining the approach we&#39;ve had in the last two games is important&mdash;building strong habits is key. We&#39;re focused on allowing players to express themselves on the field. We&#39;ve made one change today: Arshdeep Singh is out, and Ravi Bishnoi comes in.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Najmul Hossain Shanto | Bangladesh Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>&quot;Yes, I&rsquo;m happy to be bowling first, so the toss doesn&rsquo;t really matter. We&rsquo;ve made two changes. Mehidy Hasan is in and Jaker Ali is out. Mahedi Hasan and Tanzid Hasan come into the XI.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

With eleven fours and eight sixes, the wicketkeeper-batsman showcased his exceptional form, with a strike rate of 236.17. Not to be outdone, Captain Suryakumar Yadav&#39;s 75 off 35 balls demonstrated his T20 batting mastery, solidifying his reputation as one of the most formidable batsmen in this format.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Riyan Parag (34 off 13) and Hardik Pandya (47 off 18) then unleashed a fierce onslaught in the final overs, pummeling the boundary rope. Bangladesh&#39;s bowler Tanzim Hasan Sakib picked up three wickets but conceded 66 runs in 4 overs, leaving their entire bowling unit reeling from India&#39;s relentless attack.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Bangladesh&#39;s response fell short, with Parvez Hossain Emon dismissed for a golden duck, setting the tone for their innings. Despite Towhid Hridoy&#39;s resilient 63* and Litton Das&#39;s brisk 42, they never seemed to be in contention. Ravi Bishnoi was India&#39;s standout bowler, claiming 3 wickets for 30 runs in 4 overs, choking the Bangladesh middle order. Mayank Yadav&#39;s pace proved too much to handle, and Varun Chakravarthy&#39;s economical 4-0-23-0 maintained the pressure throughout.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In the end, Bangladesh&#39;s 164/7 was insufficient. India&#39;s dominant performance highlighted their strength in both batting and bowling. While questions may arise about Bangladesh&#39;s strategy, for now, India can revel in their well-deserved victory and the confidence it brings.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Najmul Hossain Shanto | Bangladesh Captain:<br />\n<span style=\"color:#27ae60\">&quot;We didn&rsquo;t play our best cricket today. We didn&rsquo;t execute our batting plans, and with the ball, we were good in patches but overall didn&rsquo;t bowl well enough.</span></strong><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>We need to believe in ourselves, and the players have to keep working on their game. I thought Hridoy batted well today, and the seamers executed their plans nicely. However, the top-order batsmen really need to improve&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sanju Samson | Player Of The Match :<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;Our dressing room is full of positive energy, and I&rsquo;m happy the team is celebrating my success. It can be frustrating at times, knowing what you&#39;re capable of, and I&#39;ve always felt I could do more. But with experience, I&rsquo;ve learned to handle pressure and deal with failures since I&rsquo;ve faced them a lot.My focus was on sticking to the process and trusting that I&rsquo;d perform. There&rsquo;s always pressure when playing for your country, but I wanted to deliver. I kept things simple, taking it one ball at a time. The leadership has shown immense faith in me, not just with words but through their actions as well.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hardik Pandya | Player Of The Series :<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;The freedom the skipper and coach have given us is really benefiting everyone in the team. It&rsquo;s allowing us to bring out the best in each other. When you enjoy each other&rsquo;s success, it creates a hunger to do even more. Physically, I&rsquo;m feeling good, and I&rsquo;m grateful for that. That shot over covers, off the back foot, was just a chip that cleared the ropes&mdash;one of my favourites because it&rsquo;s not something you pull off every day.&quot;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Suryakumar Yadav | India Captain:<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;I think we&#39;ve achieved a lot as a team. I had mentioned that we wanted to build a team of selfless cricketers, and we&rsquo;re seeing that happen, with everyone enjoying each other&rsquo;s performances. The camaraderie is really showing. As Gauti bhai said before the series, no one is bigger than the team&mdash;whether you&#39;re on 49 or 99, you still have to go for the big shot. That&#39;s exactly what Sanju did today.We need to stay flexible with both batting and bowling, and it&rsquo;s great to see bowlers stepping up when needed and batters being adaptable. Their performances were commendable. In terms of improvement, we just need to keep up the good habits on the field and remain consistent.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

With a near-unchanged lineup, the home side is looking to continue their impressive form on familiar turf.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India has a clear advantage. Their squad, led by Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and the lethal spin duo of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, is a force to be reckoned with&mdash;especially at home. The return of pace ace Jasprit Bumrah adds even more firepower to India&rsquo;s bowling attack. With only three more wins needed from their remaining eight Tests to secure a WTC final berth, the hosts are in a strong position.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>For New Zealand, the absence of Kane Williamson leaves a significant gap in their batting lineup. However, the Kiwis will need more than individual heroics to challenge India&rsquo;s depth and form.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Weather could play a role, with rain expected in Bengaluru. If the pitch becomes seamer-friendly, New Zealand might find some respite by putting India into bat under cloudy skies. But even wet conditions are unlikely to shake India&rsquo;s confidence, given their well-rounded squad.<br />\n<br />\nHead-To-Head In Tests:</strong><br />\n<br />\nIn 62 Test matches between India and New Zealand, India has claimed victory 22 times, while New Zealand has won 13 matches. The remaining 27 games ended in draws. On Indian soil, the two teams have clashed in 36 Tests, with India winning 17 and New Zealand managing only 2 wins. Notably, the Kiwis&#39; last victory in India dates back to 1988, highlighting India&#39;s dominance at home over the past few decades.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/BCCI(ICC 2024) Head to Head - 640px width (15)_1729016028.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" />&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Did You Know?</strong><br />\n<br />\nThe Last Time NZ defeated India in Tests in India, Ajaz Patel was less than 40 days old, and other New Zealand players from the current squad were not born!<br />\nNew Zealand have never defeated India in Bengaluru in their six attempts so far!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>8:57 AM IST: The Toss has been Delayed due to Rain<br />\n<br />\n11:00 AM IST: It&#39;s Still Drizzling at Bengaluru and the wait continues!<br />\n<br />\n11:30 AM IST: That Will be Lunch On Day 1!<br />\n<br />\n1:10 PM IST: Just when it seemed like the rain had eased, it&rsquo;s back again<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/rain.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n1:51 PM IST:&nbsp;The rain has stopped, and the covers are coming off.<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/clapping.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>2:00 PM IST: And... unfortunately, the covers are back on as the drizzles have returned.

A couple of guys stood up when needed, and that put us back in the game. Being 350 runs behind, we had to focus on playing each ball and building partnerships. It was a great effort not to fold under pressure.<br />\n&nbsp;Both (Sarfaraz and Pant)&nbsp; are batting heroes. Rishabh takes risks, but they pay off&mdash;it was a mature innings from him. Sarfaraz, in just his fourth Test, showed great maturity too. When you&#39;re clear-headed, things fall into place.<br />\nI knew overcast conditions would be tough, but I didn&rsquo;t expect us to be bowled out for under 50. Full credit to New Zealand for bowling brilliantly. These things happen, but we&rsquo;ll take the positives and move forward. We&rsquo;ve bounced back before, like we did against England, and we&rsquo;re ready for the next game.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tom Latham | New Zealand Captain:</strong><span style=\"color:#000000\"><br />\n<strong>&quot;We were considering batting first too, so it was a good toss to lose. The bowlers hit the right areas and bowled India out cheaply, which set things up for us. We knew India would come hard in the second innings, but we bowled well with the second new ball to finish the job.&nbsp;Honestly, I never expected that. The bowlers did a great job, and the conditions helped us, but full credit to the team. Rachin and Southee&rsquo;s partnership with the bat was also crucial for building a solid lead&nbsp;He&rsquo;s been fantastic, troubling us in the nets with his extra bounce and pace. Having Tim Southee&rsquo;s experience alongside him was brilliant.&nbsp;Rachin was outstanding with the bat, setting the tone beautifully. He&rsquo;s shown his class over the last year, and we&rsquo;re lucky to have him on our side.&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rachin Ravindra | Player of the Match:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>&quot;It&rsquo;s a nice city and a good wicket to bat on. It&rsquo;s about having clarity in what needs to be done, and preparation helps. I&rsquo;ve worked on playing on different surfaces&mdash;red soil, black soil, and against various types of bowlers. I was fortunate to get those facilities in Chennai. I wouldn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m looking to attack, but I focus on scoring when possible. The support has been amazing, and it&rsquo;s great to have family backing me, I&nbsp;enjoyed my time coming out here and playing</strong></span><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

The pitch, with lower bounce and more turn, plays perfectly into India&rsquo;s strengths, offering an ideal platform for their world-class spinners.Rohit Sharma&rsquo;s team has made a key addition with Washington Sundar, who adds depth to the attack. Meanwhile, Rishabh Pant, after his outstanding partnership with Sarfaraz Khan in Bengaluru, is fully fit and ready for action.India&rsquo;s shock first-innings collapse in the opening Test, where they were bowled out for 46, was followed by a spirited fightback, but New Zealand&rsquo;s disciplined bowling, led by Tim Southee, sealed the win.All eyes are on Rohit&#39;s men to demonstrate the cricket that has made them a powerhouse in home conditions. With their wealth of talent, strategic depth, and home advantage, Team India stands ready to produce another memorable performance in their history.<br />\n<br />\nPitch Report:&nbsp;</strong><br />\nThe surface composition is consistent&mdash;black soil characteristics are seen at both venues, Bangalore and Pune. Looking at the crucial good length zone, we&#39;re seeing significantly less moisture and minimal grass cover. With these conditions, batting first would be the optimal choice for whoever wins the toss, and spinners should find assistance right from the start.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image - 2024-10-25T102853_1729832365.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Toss</strong>:- <strong>New Zealand won the toss and elected to bat first.</strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tom Latham:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>We&#39;ve chosen to bat first today. The wicket looks somewhat changed from our previous game - much less grass coverage out there. We&#39;re anticipating the ball to turn, which is typical when playing in this region. It&#39;s been a tremendously special achievement for our squad, and while we took time to enjoy that milestone, we&#39;re now completely focused on our game here in Pune. Matt Henry misses due to niggle while Santner replaces him in the squad.</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Rohit Sharma:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>We Would have preferred to bat first as well. That first Test was challenging - the opening session didn&#39;t work in our favor, but our second innings batting showed real character. There are positive takeaways from that match which we&#39;ll look to build on here. It&#39;s crucial to find momentum when you&#39;re on the back foot in Test cricket, and that&#39;s exactly what we managed. The surface is looking quite dry. We recognize the critical importance of those initial 10 overs. We&#39;re making three changes to our lineup - we&#39;ll be without Siraj, KL and Kuldeep today. Akash Deep, Washington and Gill will take their places.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n",

Winning the toss and opting to bat first, New Zealand put up a competitive total of 259 runs, thanks to crucial half-centuries from Rachin Ravindra and Devon Conway. India&#39;s spinners dominated, with Washington Sundar claiming seven wickets and R Ashwin taking three.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In response, the Indian batting lineup struggled against New Zealand&rsquo;s spinners, particularly Mitchell Santner, who delivered a masterclass by taking seven wickets. India was bowled out for a mere 156, with Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill both scoring 30. Trailing by 103 runs, New Zealand built on their lead, scoring 255 in their second innings. Tom Latham led the charge with a resilient 86, setting India a challenging target of 359 runs. Sundar continued his good form with four wickets.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Chasing 359, India was dismissed for 245. Santner once again proved to be India&rsquo;s nemesis, picking up another five-wicket haul. Despite Jaiswal&rsquo;s fighting knock of 77, India fell short. With this victory, New Zealand sealed the series 2-0, with one match remaining.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nRohit | India captain:&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Disappointing. It&#39;s not what we expected. Got to give credit to NZ - they played better than us. We failed to capitalise on certain moments. We failed to respond to those challenges. And we sit here today. Didn&#39;t think we batted well enough to get runs on the board. You&#39;ve got to pick 20 wickets to win, yes, but batters have to put runs on the board. Was a great fightback to restrict them to 250-odd but we knew it was going to be challenging. When they started off, they were 200/3 and for us to come back and get them bowled out for 259 was a great effort. Wasn&#39;t a pitch where a lot was happening. We just didn&#39;t bat well enough. Things would&#39;ve been slightly different had we got a bit closer in the first innings. We want to show up well at Wankhede and try and win that Test. It&#39;s a collective failure. I&#39;m not somebody who would blame just the batters or the bowlers. We will come out with better intent, better ideas and better methods at Wankhede.</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Latham | NZ captain:&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#000000\">Really special feeling. Proud to be in this position. Whole team effort and a clear example of everyone pitching in. When you come over here you want to put your best foot forward. Putting runs on the board at the start was really important. Have to mention Mitch Santner. He was fantastic. Has been around the group a long time, and to finally get a break and bowl the way he has - credit to him. It was about trying to stick to our basics and play the long game. Both surfaces have been different, we&#39;ve needed to adapt and we&#39;ve done that very well. The method we played with last night - to put ourselves on the front foot - was terrifc. The way GP played this morning was really important. We knew India were going to come out hot. Didn&#39;t realise they were going to come that hot, but we managed to get the breakthroughs in the middle session. Those last two wickets took an age but when Tim took that catch we were really happy.</span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nSantner | Player of the Match:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>My approach stayed pretty consistent (in second innings). The conditions were a bit more challenging this time around. Have to acknowledge India&#39;s aggressive intent - it was probably the best way to play on that surface. We just maintained our discipline throughout. My body&#39;s feeling it now, especially the side after that extended spell of 20-plus overs. But in those moments, you just want to keep pushing through. Each wicket gave me a boost of energy. Really satisfied to have played my part in the team&#39;s success. Securing a series win here in India is something special - it&#39;s such a tough achievement. Taking wickets definitely helps build your confidence. As spinners, our focus is always on consistency - hitting those same spots repeatedly while mixing up the pace subtly - that&#39;s the foundation of our bowling unit&#39;s approach.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>India heads into the third Test at Wankhede determined to restore pride and protect their position in the World Test Championship standings. Facing an uncharacteristic 2-0 deficit at home, the team will look to rally under captain Rohit Sharma to end the series on a high. Despite setbacks in Bengaluru and Pune, India has shown resilience and will aim to bring that intensity to Mumbai.<br />\n<br />\nNew Zealand&rsquo;s success has been a testament to their preparation and persistence, with bowlers like Mitchell Santner and Ajaz Patel rising to the occasion. However, India&rsquo;s own spinners are primed for the Wankhede pitch, known for its bounce and turn, which could tilt conditions in the hosts&rsquo; favor.<br />\n<br />\nIndia&rsquo;s top order will be eager to set a strong foundation and put pressure on New Zealand, while the bowlers look to apply a decisive impact. Though the series may be out of reach, the team remains focused on delivering a performance that upholds their high standards and ensures vital WTC points. Expect an intense contest as India seeks to close out the series with renewed determination.<br />\n<br />\nToss:- New Zealand won the toss and elected to bat first.&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image - 2024-11-01T093557_1730434043.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tom Latham | New Zealand Captain: <span style=\"color:#000000\">&quot;We will bat first. It looks a good surface. Hopefully, we can put some runs on the board. Focusing on this Test. We did well in Bengaluru and Pune. But now the focus is on this one. Test Cricket is a funny game. We did not play badly against Sri Lanka. We have tried to keep things simple and play our brand of cricket. Whether you are batting first or bowling first, you have to play well. Sodhi and Henry come in for Southee and Santner&quot;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Rohit Sharma | India Captain:<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"> &quot;We would have batted as well. Yeah absolutely, we understand we haven&#39;t played well. But again gives us another opportunity to come back and looks a good wicket. Hopefully, we can restrict them to as low as possible and then do well with the bat. Right now our focus is on this Test match. On the back of the mind you need to keep in mind about that (WTC), but right now we need to play our best cricket which we haven&#39;t this series. Unfortunately, Bumrah is not well and Siraj comes in place of him.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

A result sending shockwaves through World Test Championship calculations, with India&#39;s final hopes now precariously placed.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;<strong>Rohit Sharma | India Captain:&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Losing a series or losing a Test match is never easy. It is something that is not digestible. We didn&#39;t play good cricket. New Zealand played better than us. Credit to them. We have to accept that we didn&#39;t play the best cricket and made a lot of mistakes. We didn&#39;t score enough first innings score in the previous two matches and were always behind in the game. In this game, we had the lead; we were a little ahead, but we failed to capitalize. While chasing a target, we need to have runs on the board. I had that in mind. It didn&#39;t come off. And when it doesn&#39;t come off, it looks bad. We come up with a certain mindset while batting; if it comes off, it is great, or else it looks really bad. I had specific strategies that didn&#39;t work this series. Our cricket wasn&#39;t up to par in these conditions, and we&#39;re facing those consequences. As I mentioned, our performance wasn&#39;t at its best, and that&#39;s why we&#39;re in this position. Pant, Gill, and Washington demonstrated how to bat on these surfaces - you need to be proactive. We&#39;ve been playing on similar pitches for three years now. Unfortunately, our tactical approaches didn&#39;t succeed this series. I take responsibility for not delivering my best, both as captain and batsman. As a team unit, we fell short.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Ajaz Patel | Player of the Match:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>&quot;Spin bowling is fundamentally about finding your rhythm. When conditions are favorable, you need to seize the opportunity completely. I was feeling confident during the morning session too. After lunch, there was significantly more turn which worked in my favor. My approach was to keep things uncomplicated and try to outthink the batsmen. Regarding the contest with Pant - he&#39;s an exceptional batsman who put us under considerable pressure. It required creative thinking and alternative strategies to deal with him.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Will Young | Player of the Series:&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"color:#000000\">&quot;Firstly, for the team to come here and win the series, it is huge. To win one game here is so huge, but to come out again and again and win the series with a 3-0 margin is unbelievable. Really proud of the boys. My batting approach was about simplicity. I focus on maintaining a clear mindset and trusting my defensive technique. It&#39;s also important to identify scoring opportunities. Like ducks sitting on water, staying calm. We really enjoyed playing together as a team. About taking Kane&#39;s number 3 position? Well, let&#39;s see what happens in the next series.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Tom Latham | New Zealand Captain:&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m absolutely ecstatic. Looking back at the series start, the team has performed exceptionally. To achieve this in Mumbai, on a challenging surface for both batting and bowling, is incredibly satisfying. Our success came from adapting to each venue&#39;s conditions. In Bengaluru, we had different players stepping up at crucial moments. Last week it was Mitch&#39;s performance, and this time Ajaz, who particularly enjoys bowling here in Mumbai. Our approach was about keeping things uncomplicated. This is exactly what we discussed weeks ago - being proactive and understanding India&#39;s style while adapting our game accordingly. The team executed well, and I&#39;m proud to be standing here with this result. We believed our runs were sufficient in these conditions. On this wicket, we knew it would be challenging. Each victory is special - the women&#39;s World Cup triumph is fantastic, our win here is remarkable, and the Black Caps&#39; rugby success last night makes it a brilliant time for New Zealand sports.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>India and South Africa are set for a thrilling four-match T20I series, beginning November 8 at Kingsmead Stadium, Durban. With India riding high as T20 World Champions, thanks to their recent win over South Africa in the finals, the Proteas are keen for redemption on home soil.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Led by the explosive Suryakumar Yadav, India comes in with a six-match winning streak. Despite missing some senior players, they bring young stars like Abhishek Sharma and Rinku Singh, adding depth to their power-packed lineup. South Africa, led by Aiden Markram, fields an almost full-strength squad featuring David Miller and Heinrich Klaasen, making them formidable in familiar conditions.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This series promises exciting matchups: Suryakumar&rsquo;s strokeplay against South Africa&rsquo;s pace attack and Miller&rsquo;s finishing prowess against India&rsquo;s spinners. With matches across iconic venues in Durban, Gqeberha, Centurion, and Johannesburg, fans can expect a fiercely competitive series as India looks to extend its T20 dominance, while South Africa aims to protect its home pride in what&rsquo;s sure to be an intense battle.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Head-To-Head in T20Is:<br />\nIn the 27 games battled between the two teams, India edge over South Africa by 15-11 and one game ended in no-result.<br />\n<br />\nPitch Report By Shaun Pollock:</strong></p>\n\n<p>An overcast, blustery evening sets the stage for a gripping contest here at Kingsmead. Veteran all-rounder Shaun Pollock notes the hard, true surface is primed to offer pace, bounce and carry - a tantalizing prospect for the quicks with the new ball.</p>\n\n<p>However, the capricious Durban breeze could prove a double-edged sword, potentially aiding the seamers early on, but also allowing the batters to play their strokes confidently. The captain winning the toss faces a crucial decision - capitalize on helpful bowling conditions, or post a challenging first-innings total before the forecast rain arrives later?</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Toss:- </strong>South Africa have won the toss and decided to bowl first.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Aiden Markram:</strong><strong>&nbsp;We&nbsp;will bowl first today. The pitch looks quite good, and since there&#39;s been some rain this week, we&rsquo;re hoping to use any moisture that may still be there to our advantage. It&rsquo;s also a fantastic chance for the new guys to debut on home turf, and we want them to enjoy every moment of it. We&rsquo;re a very competitive side, and our discussions have been centered on how we can drive towards positive results</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Suryakumar Yadav:&nbsp;We were hoping to bat first. The pitch looks good&mdash;much better than the practice one&mdash;so our goal is to put up a solid total. The team has made my role easier; everyone plays with a fearless mindset, just like they do for their franchises, and they&rsquo;ve brought that same energy here.</strong></span></p>\n",

After being put in to bat, India set a formidable target, reaching 202/8, thanks largely to an impressive century from Sanju Samson. He found solid support from Tilak Varma and Suryakumar Yadav, who chipped in with valuable contributions to keep the momentum going. South Africa&#39;s Gerald Coetzee was their standout bowler, claiming 3 wickets.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In pursuit of 203, South Africa struggled from the start and fell short by 61 runs, never really managing to get into the chase. India&#39;s bowlers dominated the innings, with Varun and Ravi Bishnoi sharing six wickets equally, each taking three crucial scalps. Heinrich Klaasen managed to top-score for South Africa with 25 runs, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough to steady their innings. The South African batting lineup crumbled, eventually getting bowled out for 141.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Sanju Samson (Player Of The Match)</span></strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">I&rsquo;m really enjoying my time out there in the middle. I&rsquo;ve been in good form, so I&rsquo;m making the most of it while it lasts. It all comes down to intent&mdash;we&rsquo;ve been focused on playing aggressively and keeping the team on the front foot. You have to aim for those boundary shots; sometimes they work, sometimes they don&rsquo;t. This was an important win because South Africa is a strong team, especially at home. We&rsquo;re thrilled to kick off the series in this way.</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Aiden Markram ( South Africa Captain)<br />\nThe toss didn&rsquo;t play a huge role today. The new ball had a bit of bounce and movement off the surface, which made things tricky early on. From our perspective, it really came down to our batting&mdash;we could have done better in that area.</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Suryakumar Yadav (India Captain)<br />\nOh really, I didn&rsquo;t know that! It&rsquo;s great, though, that we&rsquo;ve been sticking to our usual style of play. We haven&rsquo;t changed much, so I&rsquo;m pleased with the win. Sanju&rsquo;s hard work is paying off now&mdash;he even kept going for big shots in the 90s, always putting the team first. It&rsquo;s great to have him with us. Yes, we planned to use spinners against Miller and Klaasen, and they both delivered perfectly. Honestly, it does feel a bit easier (laughs). As I mentioned in the press conference, the team has simplified my job, and everyone understands their roles well</strong></span>.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

After Sanju Samson&#39;s masterclass lit up Durban in the opener, the visitors now have their sights set on a commanding 2-0 lead at St George&#39;s Park.The Proteas find themselves in familiar troubled waters, their batting lineup still dizzy from the spin web woven by Varun Chakaravarthy and Ravi Bishnoi. But write off Aiden Markram&#39;s men at your peril &ndash; this fortress of St George&#39;s Park has been their happy hunting ground, with three wins from their last four T20Is.South Africa&#39;s cavalry arrives in the form of Heinrich Klaasen and David Miller, two explosive game-changers who could turn the tide. Yet, the hosts&#39; Achilles heel against spin remains a concern that needs urgent addressing.Team India, meanwhile, shows no signs of tinkering with their winning formula, though opener Abhishek Sharma&#39;s form raises eyebrows. The visitors&#39; batting arsenal looks locked and loaded with Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma in murderous form.As the Sunday showdown beckons, one burning question remains: Can the Proteas solve their spin puzzle, or will India&#39;s tweakers once again prove to be their nemesis?&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report | Ashwell Prince &amp; Shaun Pollock:</strong><br />\n<strong>&quot;It&rsquo;s overcast here in Gqeberha, and there&rsquo;s a chance of rain. The pitch looks slightly different from the usual surface, with a bit more grass cover than we&rsquo;re accustomed to. The conditions have changed slightly with the cloud cover and recent rain, which will likely favour the seamers. The grass should help the seam bowlers get some movement, and though it&rsquo;s firm and solid, batters should feel encouraged too. There isn&rsquo;t expected to be much spin tonight, but this venue often holds something for the spinners despite appearances. South Africa struggled against spin in the first T20I, so it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see if that plays a role here. The surface is hard underneath, meaning the ball should carry nicely through to the keeper.It looks like a good pitch to the eye, with something for both batters and seamers. The key question: will India&rsquo;s two spinners enjoy these conditions? With rain looming, teams might prefer to bowl first.&quot;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#16a085\">South Africa Won the Toss and Elected to field&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\nAiden Markram | South Africa Captain:</strong><br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#16a085\">&quot;We&rsquo;re opting to bowl first with a bit of rain around. Hopefully, there&rsquo;ll be some assistance for the seamers early on. Reeza Hendricks is back in, replacing Patrick Kruger. For us, it&rsquo;s about winning those 240 balls of cricket, and staying focused on playing well rather than worrying about the result. Hopefully, the outcome will be in our favor.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\nSuryakumar Yadav | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We achieved what we set out to in the first T20I. We wanted to bat first, make a statement, and stick to our brand of cricket, so I&rsquo;m happy with how things went. Every game teaches you something, and we want to build on those good habits&mdash;just play our game, enjoy the little things.

Opting to bowl, the Proteas&#39; disciplined attack stifled India from the outset. Early dismissals of Samson, Sharma and Yadav left the visitors reeling at 15/3. Pandya&#39;s gritty 39* lifted India to 124/6, but it seemed under par. The South African chase stumbled as spin wizard Chakravarthy spun a web, his 5/17 leaving the hosts 86/7. However, local hero Stubbs (47*) and Coetzee engineered a vital 42-run stand to take SA over the line. Despite Chakravarthy&#39;s heroics, India&#39;s pacers couldn&#39;t close it out, allowing the SA tail to hold their nerve. This absorbing encounter sets up a mouthwatering decider, with both sides showcasing resilience and match-winners. South Africa&#39;s bowlers first set the tone, before Stubbs&#39; composure and Chakravarthy&#39;s brilliance provided the drama in a low-scoring thriller. The series is evenly poised, primed for an enthralling finale&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nTristan Stubbs | Player of the Match:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;We were lucky that the required rate never got out of hand. I aimed to get around 30 off the last three overs, and with some help from the dew and Coetzee&rsquo;s big shots, we managed to cross the line. Playing here, with the crowd behind us, is always special. Now that it&rsquo;s 1-1, we have everything to play for in the next match.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Suryakumar Yadav | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We always back whatever total we put up, and I reminded the team to fight till the end, regardless of the score. In T20, defending 125 isn&rsquo;t ideal, but I&rsquo;m proud of how we bowled. Varun Chakaravarthy&rsquo;s five-wicket haul was remarkable, especially under pressure defending a low total. He&rsquo;s worked hard, and it showed today. We&rsquo;re heading to Jo&rsquo;burg with the series tied 1-1, and it promises to be exciting cricket.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Aiden Markram | South Africa Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;I thought we bowled well today; the bowlers stuck to the plans, and I&rsquo;m proud of them. Our batting wasn&rsquo;t great as we lost wickets in clusters, which made things tricky. Thankfully, my finger&rsquo;s doing fine. Hats off to Coetzee and Stubbs&mdash;they came off a break and showed great hunger. To deliver such a performance against India is always satisfying. Levelling the series going into the Highveld is fantastic, even if it wasn&rsquo;t the way we ideally wanted to get over the line.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

The catch was tricky under the lights, but I&rsquo;m doing well now. Honestly, I can&rsquo;t describe it&mdash;it was a dream to score a hundred for my country, and I&rsquo;m really happy. All credit to our captain, Suryakumar Yadav, for giving me the opportunity at number three. He encouraged me before the game, saying I had the potential for this role. Huge thanks to him for the support.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Aiden Markram | South Africa Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;Really proud of the team, especially with the contributions from the middle and lower middle order. Here in Centurion, when the middle order steps up, it usually sets you up for a strong finish. Once a partnership builds, things can escalate quickly. At this venue, you almost expect to chase totals down&mdash;it becomes an over-by-over battle. Marco was fantastic in the last over; if you keep doing the right things, success follows. The batters can take confidence from this, and the bowlers will look to fine-tune their skills before we head to Joburg.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Suryakumar Yadav | India Captain:&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;As captain, I felt we played the brand of cricket we set out to play. We&rsquo;ve been talking about playing the way we do for our franchises or state teams, and I believe staying clear-minded is crucial. Watching our batters perform like they did today made my job so much easier, and it feels like we&rsquo;re moving in the right direction as a team. The energy, aggression, and intent on display were really satisfying to see. Tilak Varma actually came to my room before the game and asked if he could bat at number 3, and I&rsquo;m really happy for him and his family that it worked out so well.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

India, leading 2-1, look to cap off their outstanding T20I Campaign with another victory.The visitors have found different heroes throughout - Samson&#39;s ton in the opener, Chakravarthy&#39;s five-fer in the second, and Tilak Varma&#39;s maiden T20I century in Centurion steering them to an unassailable lead.Despite captain Markram winning all three tosses, South Africa hasn&#39;t converted advantages into victories. Their batting lacks consistency while bowling discipline remains a concern. Still seeking their first bilateral T20I series win in eight attempts, the Proteas aim to level the series 2-2.The Wanderers&#39; pace-friendly conditions could favor the hosts&#39; fast bowling arsenal. However, India&#39;s new aggressive batting approach, evident throughout 2024, makes them favorites even on bouncy tracks.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India Won The Toss and Elected to Bat&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\nSuryakumar Yadav | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We&rsquo;re batting first again, as we&rsquo;ve been doing well with that approach and want to keep the momentum. Our plan is clear: put runs on the board and defend strongly. The boys have performed well, and I&rsquo;m confident everyone is ready for the challenge with the series on the line. No changes to the playing XI.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Aiden Markram | South Africa Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;We were leaning towards batting but weren&rsquo;t entirely sure, so it wasn&rsquo;t the worst toss to lose. Our focus today is to put together a complete performance in all three departments, something we haven&rsquo;t fully achieved yet. We&rsquo;re getting closer to that 100% mark. Playing at the Bullring is always exciting, and while we can only level the series, coming back from 1-0 down gives us confidence. That said, execution will be key. We&rsquo;re sticking with the same team.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

I wanted to back myself, stay calm, and follow my basics. I never imagined scoring a century in South Africa. I&#39;m grateful to God and captain Suryakumar for the opportunity to bat at number 3.

We were hoping to level the series, but credit to them for their clinical display. You can&#39;t just hit the stumps these days - you need to use the crease, bowl wider, and challenge the batters.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Suryakumar Yadav | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;There&#39;s no secret to adapting to situations. Our plans were clear from the start, and we wanted to continue the way we played on our last tour. The batting performances from Sanju, Tilak, and Abhishek were simply amazing. The wicket had something in it after the temperature dropped, and our bowlers executed our plans to perfection. Winning the T20 WC has given us a big boost, and this series victory in South Africa will stay with me forever. The coaching staff gave the boys the freedom to express themselves, and that&#39;s what they did.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

This five-match Test series is pivotal for both teams, with significant implications for the ICC World Test Championship (WTC) standings.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>India, currently second on the WTC table, faces a formidable challenge. To secure a spot in the WTC final, they must clinch four out of the five Tests&mdash;a daunting task, especially on Australian soil. The series opener at Perth&#39;s Optus Stadium adds to the intrigue, as Australia boasts an unbeaten record at this venue. Compounding India&#39;s challenges, captain Rohit Sharma is unavailable for the first Test due to personal reasons, and opener Shubman Gill has been sidelined with a thumb injury. In their absence, vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah will lead the side, with seasoned campaigner Virat Kohli anchoring a batting lineup infused with youthful talent eager to make their mark.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Despite a recent 3-0 series loss to New Zealand, India remain optimistic. The team is determined to reverse their fortunes and draw inspiration from their previous successes Down Under. The blend of experience and fresh energy could be the catalyst they need to challenge Australia&#39;s dominance.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Australia, perched atop the WTC standings, enters the series with confidence. Although they haven&#39;t played a Test in over six months, their formidable record at the Optus Stadium and the prospect of a subsequent series against Sri Lanka keep them focused. To secure their place in the WTC final, Australia needs four wins from their remaining seven matches. The team is keen to reclaim the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, having lost the last two home series to India.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>As the top two teams in Test cricket collide, fans can anticipate a series brimming with intensity, skill, and drama. Will India&#39;s resilience and hunger for redemption prevail, or will Australia&#39;s home advantage and strategic acumen secure them the series? Cricket enthusiasts worldwide await the unfolding of this epic contest.<br />\n<br />\nHead-To-Head in BGT:</strong><br />\n<strong>In the 56 matches contested between the two teams, India edged out Australia with 24 wins to 20 wins, while 12 of the other matches&nbsp;ended in a draw.</strong><br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/BCCI(ICC 2024) Head to Head - 640px width (16)_1732190896.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE: India won the Toss and Elected to Bat First&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jasprit Bumrah | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We are going to bat first.

We also had a good experience playing at the WACA recently.We played a Test here in 2018, so we know what to expect. The pitch tends to get quicker as the game progresses. Nitish Kumar Reddy makes his debut as a fast-bowling all-rounder. We have four fast bowlers in the lineup, along with Washi.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pat Cummins | Australia Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s right. It was a 50-50 decision. The sun hasn&#39;t been out much, so it&#39;s fine. Any format between these two sides is always fiercely competitive. Test matches, in particular, are even more intense and closely contested. Nathan McSweeney makes his Test debut today and will bat at the top of the order. The rest of the team remains unchanged.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

The visitors eventually secured a vital 46-run first-innings lead.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The match transformed dramatically as openers Yashasvi Jaiswal (161) and KL Rahul (77) crafted a record-breaking partnership - the highest by an Indian opening pair in Australia. Jaiswal became only the third Indian to score a century on debut in Australia, while Virat Kohli&#39;s masterful 30th Test hundred (100*) helped set an imposing 534-run target.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Despite Travis Head&#39;s counter-attacking 89, Australia&#39;s fortress finally crumbled on Day 4. The hosts, who had never lost at Perth Stadium in four previous Tests, were dismissed for 238, with Bumrah and Siraj leading India&#39;s charge.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India&#39;s victory ranks alongside their famous wins at Gabba 2021 and Adelaide 2003. Captain Bumrah&#39;s leadership and bowling excellence epitomized India&#39;s dominance, turning early adversity into their biggest win against Australia - a historic triumph that takes them to No.1 in the WTC standings&nbsp;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pat Cummins | Australia Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;It&rsquo;s fairly disappointing, especially given how well we prepared for the game. But cricket is like that&mdash;you have to get back on the horse quickly after a loss. We&rsquo;ll take a couple of days off and then return to the field in Adelaide.We didn&rsquo;t really give ourselves a chance, particularly during that tricky period on Day 1. If we had navigated it better, things could have turned out differently. There are plenty of experienced players in the dressing room, and this is just the start of a big summer. It&rsquo;s a sample size of one, and I&rsquo;m confident we&rsquo;ll bounce back. Lots of conversations ahead to set things right.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jasprit Bumrah&nbsp; | India Captain &amp; Player of the Match:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Feeling very happy. We were under pressure in the first innings, but the way we responded was fantastic. I remember playing here in 2018&mdash;the wicket back then started soft, but this one was less spicy. Our preparation paid off well. I kept reminding everyone to trust their abilities, and it worked.Jaiswal played his best Test innings so far; his shot selection and judgment were excellent. As for Virat, I never felt he was out of form. It&rsquo;s tough to judge on challenging pitches, but he looked solid in the nets and performed well. The crowd&rsquo;s support was amazing as always&mdash;it lifts us, and we feed off that energy.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Captain Rohit Sharma&#39;s return fortifies an already formidable lineup, with the skipper opting to bat in the middle order. This tactical decision maintains the momentum of the successful opening combination of KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal, who have shown remarkable understanding at the top.The Adelaide Oval holds special significance for India, particularly Virat Kohli, whose record at this venue stands testament to his mastery in Australian conditions. His recent form, coupled with the team&#39;s comprehensive preparation in the practice match against the PM&#39;s XI, positions India strongly for this crucial encounter.India&#39;s bowling arsenal, led by the exceptional Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj, has already demonstrated their ability to dominate in Australian conditions.The visitors&#39; preparation has been meticulous, with specific focus on adapting to the unique challenges of pink-ball cricket. The return of Shubman Gill, who looked in sublime touch during the practice match, further strengthens India&#39;s batting credentials.As the sun sets over Adelaide&#39;s picturesque skyline, this promises to be a fascinating contest where India&#39;s tactical acumen and batting prowess meet the challenges of day-night Test cricket. With momentum firmly on their side, Team India looks primed to script another memorable chapter in their Australian sojourn</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div>\n<p><strong>Pitch Report | Matthew Hayden &amp; Sunil Gavaskar</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>&quot;About a week ago, there was a lot of grass on the pitch, but much of it has been trimmed over the last few days. There&rsquo;s still around 6 mm left, which should offer plenty of assistance to the fast bowlers when the ball is new and hard. After that initial period, Adelaide pitches are typically good for batting. It looks like it could seam around quite a bit early on. Eventually, batting becomes easier, but bowlers often dominate late on Day 2, and averages dip. I&rsquo;ve also noticed lines running up and down the wicket, with thicker grass cover than last year.&quot;&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n\n<div><br />\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE:</strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong> India Won the Toss and Elected to Bat&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;\n<p><strong>Rohit Sharma | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We&rsquo;d like to bat first. The pitch looks good&mdash;slightly dry but with enough grass for some early carry. As the game progresses, it should become better for batting and offer something for everyone, so we&rsquo;re in for a good contest. I&rsquo;ve been here for about two weeks now, had good net sessions, and even played a practice game, so I&rsquo;m ready. The team&rsquo;s mood is vibrant. We put in a great performance in Perth and want to carry that momentum. It&rsquo;s a long series, and while breaks are welcome, maintaining the rhythm is crucial. We&rsquo;ve made three changes. I&rsquo;m back, Gill is back, and Ashwin returns in place of Washi, Padikkal, and Jurel. I&rsquo;ll be batting in the middle order&mdash;it&rsquo;s different, but I&rsquo;m ready for the challenge.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Pat Cummins | Australia Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;Yes, we would have chosen to bat first. But on Day 1 with a pink ball, it might nip around a bit. It&rsquo;s always nice to start fresh here&mdash;we&rsquo;ve had success at this venue. Every series against India seems to bring that challenge, and though we weren&rsquo;t at our best last week, preparations have been good, and the boys are ready. There might be more swing today since it&rsquo;s muggy, but hopefully, it&#39;s not as bad as yesterday. We&rsquo;ve made one change: Josh Hazlewood is out, and Scott Boland comes in.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n",

I just tried to make the most of it, and luckily, I managed to get things rolling.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rohit Sharma | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;It was a disappointing week for us. Australia simply played better cricket. We had our moments, but failing to capitalize on them cost us the game.What we did in Perth was special, and we wanted to replicate that here. But every Test comes with its own set of challenges. We knew it would be tough, but credit to Australia &ndash; they were the better side in this match.There&rsquo;s not much time before the next Test, and as a team, we&rsquo;re eager to reflect on what worked for us in Perth and what we did well the last time we played at the Gabba. We&rsquo;ll take those lessons and aim to bounce back.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pat Cummins | Australia Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;It&rsquo;s been a fantastic week. We were far from the team we wanted to be in Perth, but this is exactly how we aim to play.It feels great to pick up a few wickets, and I&rsquo;m really happy with the fifer. Starc was amazing out there &ndash; he&rsquo;s been doing it consistently for over a decade, and I feel very lucky and privileged to share the field with him.Head loves batting here, no doubt about it. When he came in, the game could have gone either way, but he turned the momentum in our favor brilliantly.The lead was crucial for us. Bowling under lights was a perfect scenario &ndash; the ball moved a lot, and it played into our hands. While the pink ball does a bit more under lights, the key was securing that big first-innings lead.Scotty was fantastic, seamlessly fitting in as he always does. Hopefully, Joshy will be ready for the next Test, but if not, Scotty is just incredible.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>The Brisbane Cricket Ground (Gabba) is ready to witness a gripping encounter as Australia and India prepare for the third Test, with the series tied at 1-1. Both teams will be looking to take the lead in what promises to be an epic battle, and the stakes couldn&rsquo;t be higher.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Australia enters the contest riding high after their resounding 10-wicket win over India at the Adelaide Oval. Their dominance with the pink ball has set the tone for the series, and they&rsquo;ll look to continue that momentum as they return to their fortress&mdash;the Gabba. Despite their recent strong record here, Australia is haunted by the fact they&rsquo;ve lost two out of the last four games played at this very venue. The hosts will be eager to put that behind them and showcase their strengths. Travis Head has been sublime, scoring 89 in Perth and 140 in Adelaide, while Marnus Labuschagne has been another contributor. The bowling attack has been firing on all cylinders, with Mitchell Starc taking a match-winning six wickets in the first innings and Pat Cummins claiming a five-fer in the second. Scott Boland has also been key, dismissing Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma in either of the innings.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>On the other hand, India enters this Test with plenty to prove after their batting struggles in three of the four innings so far. Despite this, there have been moments of brilliance, notably from Nitish Reddy, who has been positive, and Kohli and Jaiswal, scoring centuries in Perth. Jasprit Bumrah has been India&rsquo;s standout bowler with 12 wickets to his name, while Mohammad Siraj has also contributed with a four-wicket haul in Adelaide. India&rsquo;s historic three-wicket win at the Gabba last time is still fresh in their minds&mdash;will they replicate that remarkable achievement?</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>The series is poised for an intense showdown. Will Pat Cummins and his men continue their dominance, or will India deliver another stunning performance like they did at the Gabba last time? The battle for supremacy is on&mdash;who will rise to the occasion and take the lead in this high-stakes contest?&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE : <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India Won the Toss and Elected to Field&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rohit Sharma | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We&rsquo;ve decided to bowl first. It&rsquo;s a bit overcast, and the surface looks soft. It might stick a bit, so we want to take advantage of these conditions.There&rsquo;s a lot to play for. Both teams have played well so far, and we&rsquo;re looking to bring our best. We know we&rsquo;ve been playing good cricket, but we need to capitalize on key moments, something we didn&rsquo;t do in the last Test.The guys are excited and eager to do well for their country. They want to get out there and make an impact.&nbsp;The surface does look a bit soft, and with the overcast conditions, we expect it to improve as the game progresses.We&rsquo;ve made two changes: Jadeja and Akash&nbsp;Deep come in for Harshit&nbsp;Rana and Ashwin&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Pat Cummins | Australia Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;I believe this looks like a good wicket, and I&rsquo;m hoping we can put some solid runs on the board. It&rsquo;s going to be a sell-out crowd, and I expect it to be pretty loud. We had a great week in Adelaide, and I&rsquo;m really happy with how things played out. Everyone played their part. The weather in Brisbane hasn&rsquo;t impacted our preparations, and we&rsquo;ve had a good lead-up to this game. We love playing here at the Gabba, and we&rsquo;re excited for this match.

Australia, after put into bat first, amassed a formidable 445, propelled by centuries from Steve Smith and Travis Head. Smith&#39;s 101 marked a return to form, while Head&#39;s aggressive 152 showcased his growing stature in the lineup. India&#39;s spearhead, Jasprit Bumrah, was the standout bowler, claiming six wickets for 76 runs.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>In reply, India faced early setbacks, slipping to 74 for 5. However, resilient half-centuries from KL Rahul (84) and Ravindra Jadeja (75) steadied the innings. A crucial last-wicket partnership of 47 between Bumrah and debutant Akash Deep enabled India to reach 260, narrowly avoiding the follow-on. Australian pacers Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc were instrumental, securing four and three wickets respectively.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Persistent rain disruptions played a significant role throughout the match. Australia, with a first-innings lead of 185, declared their second innings at 89 for 7, setting India a target of 275. Bumrah continued his impressive form, taking three wickets, while Akash Deep and Mohammed Siraj shared two apiece.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>India began their chase confidently, reaching 8 without loss in 2.1 overs before rain intervened once more. The inclement weather persisted, forcing the match to end in a draw. This result keeps the series level, setting the stage for a compelling fourth Test.<br />\n<br />\nRohit Sharma: India Captain</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We&#39;ll take this result. While the weather interruptions weren&#39;t ideal, heading to Melbourne with the series level at 1-1 gives us real momentum. After lunch on Day 4, we were in a tricky spot and needed someone to step up - with the weather forecast in mind, we knew we weren&#39;t going to get a full game in.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Impressed with Jadeja&#39;s performance, and Rahul&#39;s batting at the top was outstanding. The partnership between Akash Deep and Bumrah was fantastic to watch - they&#39;ve been putting in so much effort on their batting in practice sessions.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Bumrah was exceptional with the ball, and Akash Deep brings such great energy - he&#39;s always looking to make an impact in every aspect of the game. Though he&#39;s still finding his feet in international cricket, his work ethic has been tremendous. It&#39;s great to see the senior players in the group helping guide him. His batting performance showed exactly the kind of character we want in this team - someone who&#39;s willing to fight for every run.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Pat Cummins: Australia Captain<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\">&quot;We&#39;d prefer to be leading 2-1, but with all the rain interruptions, that was out of our control. Getting that massive total on the board put us in a commanding position from the start. Feel for Josh Hazlewood - it was just one of those situations, though the rain breaks actually worked in our favor since Mitch and I could keep going.</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>The day 5 pitch had its moments of variable bounce, though it hadn&#39;t seen much action. The new ball definitely posed some challenges. Really proud of how Smith and Head batted - they were exceptional, and Alex Carey&#39;s contribution was crucial too. Nathan Lyon looked in great rhythm, Starc kept picking up important wickets - pretty much everything went according to plan.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>The Boxing Day atmosphere at the MCG with a packed house is something special - it&#39;s one of those uniquely Australian cricket moments that gets you excited from the moment you wake up.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Travis Head: Player Of The Match</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;To be honest, it feels like ages since I was at the crease. I&#39;m pleased I could make an impact and help set up the team&#39;s position with my batting in the first innings. The pitch presented some real challenges, but I managed to adapt my game as needed and I&#39;m satisfied with how I worked through those different phases. I think I&#39;ve been reading the conditions pretty well throughout this series, and I&#39;m particularly happy with the rhythm I&#39;ve found in my batting.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>The partnership with Smith was great - we kept the communication simple and clear. Seeing him batting so smoothly at the other end boosted my confidence, and we clicked well together out there. My approach when I first come in is always about figuring out what the situation demands and finding solutions to whatever challenges come up. Physically, I&#39;m carrying a bit of soreness but should be good to go for the next match.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Opting to bat first, Australia posted a formidable 474 in the first innings, powered by a superb century from Steve Smith and vital half-centuries from Usman Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne. Jasprit Bumrah was the standout bowler for India, claiming four wickets.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India&rsquo;s reply saw Nitish Kumar Reddy shine with a brilliant century, supported by Yashasvi Jaiswal&rsquo;s steady 82 and Washington Sundar&rsquo;s gritty fifty. However, the Australian bowlers, led by Pat Cummins, Scott Boland, and Nathan Lyon, each with three wickets, ensured India could only manage 369, giving Australia a crucial 105-run lead.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In their second innings, Australia added 234 runs, with Labuschagne top-scoring with 70 and Bumrah picking up a fifer. India faced a daunting target of 340 on the final day. The chase began poorly as India lost key batters before lunch. Despite a resilient partnership between Rishabh Pant and Jaiswal in the second session, India&rsquo;s batting crumbled in the evening, all out for 155. Boland and Cummins were once again the wreckers-in-chief, picking three wickets each.<br />\n<br />\nRohit Sharma (India Captain):</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;This loss cuts deep. We didn&#39;t enter this match planning to surrender - our intention was to battle until the final ball, but things didn&#39;t unfold that way. While the last two sessions are fresh in everyone&#39;s mind, we need to look at the complete picture. The opportunities were there throughout the match; we had Australia on the ropes at 90/6. Despite knowing cricket can be unforgiving, our goal is to rise above challenging situations. I spent time in my room afterward, reflecting on our strategies, and I believe we gave it our all. That final partnership really turned the tide against us. Chasing 340 was always going to be a mountain to climb. Our plan was to build a foundation and keep wickets intact heading into those crucial final sessions, but I must acknowledge their exceptional bowling. We had our sights set on the target, but failed to establish the platform we needed. Winning Test matches requires finding different pathways to success, and we fell short in discovering those routes.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Regarding NKR, he&#39;s experiencing these conditions for the first time, and they can be incredibly challenging. His display of character and technical prowess was impressive. He possesses all the qualities needed for success at this level, and I&#39;m hopeful his journey will be one of continuous growth. He has the complete support of this team behind him.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">As for Bumrah, his performance was nothing short of exceptional. We&#39;ve witnessed his evolution over the years, and his impact here was remarkable. He&#39;s never been one to chase statistics - his focus is purely on serving the country and contributing to the team&#39;s success. Unfortunately, he didn&#39;t receive the support he deserved from the other end.&quot;</span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Pat Cummins (Australia Captain and Player of The Match):</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>&quot;This Test match was simply extraordinary - I&#39;d rank it among the finest I&#39;ve ever participated in. The atmosphere created by the crowd throughout the week was incredible, and being part of such an occasion was special. I owe a lot to Marnus for his guidance during my second innings, and I&#39;m pleased I could play my part. Steve&#39;s batting was remarkable - considering we won the toss and faced challenging conditions on day one, posting a total in the high 400s was a fantastic achievement.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Our batting strategy was deliberately focused on eliminating any possibility of an Indian victory. With a comfortable run cushion, we maximized our opportunities to crowd the batsmen with close-in fielders. We&#39;ve invested significant effort in developing our lower-order batting skills, primarily focusing on understanding how to bowl effectively to opposition batters, but also ensuring we can contribute meaningful runs. The over rate situation influenced our decision to bring Travis in - we thought that might help us manage that aspect better.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Smith&#39;s performance was a masterclass in batting on this surface. His brilliant innings, combined with some crucial catches in the slips - something that often goes unnoticed - really showcased his value. There&#39;s a great feeling of satisfaction in the dressing room right now. We&#39;re going to take some time to enjoy this victory before shifting our focus to Sydney.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

We&rsquo;ve made two changes: Rohit Sharma rests, and Akash Deep is out due to injury. Prasidh Krishna comes into the XI.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pat Cummins | Australia Captain</strong>:<br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;We would have chosen to bat first too, but with the overcast conditions, we&rsquo;re hoping to make the most of it early on.Last week in Melbourne was incredible, and we&rsquo;re aiming for a similar performance here. The first few days seem to be sold out, which is fantastic.The team had three days to recover, and everyone is feeling good. Cricket here grows bigger every summer. Just one change for us: Beau Webster makes his debut, replacing Mitch Marsh.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"promptbox_extension_root\">&nbsp;</div>\n",

The debutant&#39;s unbeaten partnership with Head steering Australia home in a chase of 162, transforming early pressure into calculated triumph.The match&#39;s complexion shifted dramatically from Pant&#39;s blazing 61 off 33 balls to Boland&#39;s masterful six-wicket haul. Krishna&#39;s fierce spell injected brief hope - removing Smith on 9,999 Test runs and reducing Australia to 58/3 - but the target proved insufficient without Bumrah&#39;s services in the final innings.The series&#39; defining narrative emerges through contrasts: Bumrah&#39;s record 32 wickets stand tall amidst India&#39;s batting fragilities, and Australia&#39;s resilience after Perth defeat powers their 3-1 victory. From Adelaide&#39;s turnaround to Melbourne&#39;s dominance, culminating in Sydney&#39;s swift three-day finish on an unexpectedly spicy pitch. For Australia, the victory heals past wounds and sets up a Lord&#39;s date with South Africa to defend their WTC crown.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nScott Boland&nbsp; | Player Of The Match</strong>:<span style=\"color:#16a085\"> </span><strong><span style=\"color:#16a085\">&quot;An incredible couple of months.

Missing the spiciest pitch of the series was frustrating, but that&#39;s cricket. Our bowlers showed tremendous character stepping up when we were one short. The belief was always there. Congratulations to Australia - they fought exceptionally well. We&#39;ll take these lessons forward.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Pat Cummins | Australia Captain</strong>:<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong> &quot;This is special - the Border-Gavaskar Trophy was the one missing from our cabinet. I am immensely proud of how we bounced back after Perth, staying clear with our plans throughout. Using our entire squad proved crucial in a five-Test series - three debutants stepping up at different moments, especially Webster&#39;s magnificent debut here.The key to beating India was our senior players delivering in crucial moments, while maintaining adaptability with our plans. Special mention to Rohit and Bumrah - this series showcased Test cricket at its finest. And to end it on Jane McGrath Day in Sydney makes it even more meaningful.Will definitely go down as my favorite series to lead. Privileged to captain this special group.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Cricket fans worldwide are eagerly awaiting the epic clash between India and England as they prepare for a thrilling five-match T20I series, starting January 22 at the iconic Eden Gardens. The action doesn&rsquo;t stop there, as a three-match ODI series will follow, serving as a prelude to the Champions Trophy.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Defending champions India, led by the electrifying Suryakumar Yadav, are riding high on their recent successes. The team has won every series since their triumphant T20 World Cup 2024 campaign, showcasing their brand of aggressive and fearless cricket&mdash;aptly called &quot;SKYball.&quot; With Suryakumar&rsquo;s innovative batting and a team built around attacking intent, India is looking to dominate on home soil. The return of veteran pacer Mohammed Shami adds a new dimension, strengthening their formidable squad.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>England, under new head coach Brendon McCullum, are introducing their bold &quot;Bazball&quot; philosophy to the shortest format. Led by the explosive Jos Buttler, the visitors boast a perfect blend of experience and youthful talent. This is England&rsquo;s first series in their new era, and they are determined to prove their mettle against the hosts.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>As both teams eye the T20 World Cup 2026 , co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, this series is more than just a bilateral contest. It&rsquo;s a stage for SKYball and Bazball to collide, showcasing two revolutionary cricketing styles. Will India&rsquo;s fearless SKYball dominate, or can England&rsquo;s daring Bazball reign supreme? Fans are bracing for a spectacle that promises unforgettable moments.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report by Deep Dasgupta and Nick Knight:</strong><br />\n<strong>&quot;The six-hitting festival begins today at the iconic Eden Gardens Stadium. Over the last two years, this venue has averaged 10 sixes per innings in T20 games, making it a paradise for big hitters. The dimensions are batter-friendly&mdash;59m and 66m square boundaries, with 75m straight down the ground.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The pitch has a nice tinge of green, though it&rsquo;s not overly green. It won&rsquo;t do much, but there will be enough in it for the bowlers early on. The tall England bowlers could extract some bounce and carry from the surface, which will be an advantage for them.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Traditionally, Eden Gardens is a high-scoring venue, and we expect plenty of runs today. The surface looks a bit drier and white-ish right now but will likely darken as the game progresses due to the dew factor. This means the ball will skid on, adding to the challenge for bowlers.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>There&rsquo;s not much on offer for the spinners, as it doesn&rsquo;t seem like it will spin much. With more carry and pace, batters will look to dominate, and there will be pressure on the bowlers to execute their plans perfectly.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Toss Update:</strong> <span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India won the toss and have opted to chase!&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Suryakumar Yadav:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We will look to bowl first. The wicket looks a bit sticky, and there will be dew later on, which will make it heavier as the game progresses. The boys have been amazing, and the preparations have gone really well. We&rsquo;re looking forward to this series&mdash;it&rsquo;s going to be a great competition between both sides.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>It&rsquo;s a good headache to have, but we want to stick to our strengths and play to our game plan.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Jos Buttler:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;It looks like a good wicket, and we&rsquo;re sure it&rsquo;s going to be an exciting match. There will be some dew around, which might play a part later. This is a great ground, and it&rsquo;s always an honour to play against India in these conditions.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Everyone in the squad is in a good place, and it&rsquo;s nice to have the team together. With McCullum taking charge, his experience brings a lot to the group. It&rsquo;s going to be a challenge, but we&rsquo;re up for it. There&rsquo;s some incredible talent on both sides, which should make for a fantastic contest.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Saqib Mahmood, Brydon Carse, Jamie Smith, and Rehan Ahmed will miss out for this game.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",
        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Powerplay (1 - 6 Overs) :&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"color:#e74c3c\">ENG - 46/2 (7.66 rpo, 8x4, 0x6) </span>||<span style=\"color:#e74c3c\"> </span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">IND - 63/2 (10.50 rpo 7x4, 4x6)</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Middle Overs (7 - 15 Overs) :&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"color:#e74c3c\">ENG - 53/4 (5.8 rpo, 3x4, 2x6)&nbsp;</span>||&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">IND - 70/1 (10.24 rpo 5x4, 5x6)</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Death Overs (16 - 20 Overs) :&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"color:#e74c3c\">ENG - 33/4 (6.6 rpo, 2x4, 3x6)</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>India showcased their dominance with a commanding seven-wicket win over England in the opening T20I at Eden Gardens, taking a 1-0 lead in the five-match series. Put into bat first, England struggled to build momentum against a disciplined Indian bowling attack and were bowled out for 132. Jos Buttler was the standout performer for the visitors, playing a resilient knock of 68, but lacked support from the other end.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India&rsquo;s bowling unit delivered an all-round performance, with Varun Chakaravarthy leading the way with a brilliant three-wicket haul. Arshdeep Singh, Hardik Pandya, and Axar Patel complemented him well, each picking up two wickets to restrict England to a modest total.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Chasing 133, India&rsquo;s batting lineup made light work of the target. Abhishek Sharma stole the show with a dazzling 79 off just 34 balls, playing an array of impressive shots to put India firmly in control. Sanju Samson provided solid support with a quickfire 26 off 20 deliveries, ensuring a smooth chase. The hosts crossed the finish line in just 12.5 overs, completing a thoroughly professional performance.<br />\n<br />\nJos Buttler&nbsp; (England Skipper):</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">&quot;There was a little bit in the wicket early on, and unfortunately, we lost a couple of wickets. Jofra (Archer) always looks good&mdash;he&rsquo;s an absolute superstar. Watching him and Wood operate together is really exciting; they bring so much to the team.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">From venue to venue, it&rsquo;s crucial to assess the conditions quickly and adapt your game accordingly. Personally, I&rsquo;m really enjoying the environment within the team. I&rsquo;ve always been a big fan of Brendon McCullum, and it&rsquo;s fantastic to be working with him. His approach and insights have been invaluable.&quot;</span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Suryakumar Yadav (India Skipper):</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;The energy after winning the toss set the benchmark for the game. The bowlers had clear plans and executed them brilliantly, and the way we batted was the icing on the cake.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">We followed a similar approach to what we did in South Africa, where Hardik took responsibility with the new ball, giving us the cushion to play the extra spinner. Varun&#39;s preparations have been spot-on, and Arshdeep has stepped up by taking extra responsibility, which is great to see.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">There&rsquo;s a lot of freedom within the team, and we want to play a bit differently, pushing boundaries to improve. Fielding has been a key focus for us&mdash;we&rsquo;ve been working really hard on it. Taking those half-chances and making a difference in the field can be crucial in tight games.&quot;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Varun Chakaravarthy (Player of the Match):</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;I&#39;m quite used to seeing such pitches during the IPL, so I had a fair idea of what lengths would work for me. My focus was on keeping the ball away from the batters&#39; arc to make it harder for them.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Bowling at Eden Gardens is always challenging, especially with every over bringing a new test. The last over, in particular, was very tough, but by God&#39;s grace, I managed to pull it off.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>I can&#39;t rely on side spin to beat the batsmen&mdash;bounce is my primary weapon. That&rsquo;s what I try to use to my advantage. I&rsquo;d rate myself a 7 out of 10 at the moment; there&rsquo;s still more work to do, and I&rsquo;m committed to improving further.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

With the series tantalizingly poised, the hosts are eyeing a 2-0 lead, while the visitors are desperate to bounce back and restore parity.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>India, riding high on confidence after a comprehensive seven-wicket win in the series opener, look unstoppable. Abhishek Sharma dazzled in the first game with an unforgettable 34-ball 79, tearing apart England&rsquo;s bowlers and finishing the chase with an astonishing 43 balls to spare. Backed by Varun Chakravarthy&rsquo;s spellbinding three-wicket haul and a flawless display from the bowling unit, India showcased their SKYball brand of cricket to perfection. Now, with the vibrant Chennai crowd behind them, they&rsquo;ll aim to tighten their grip on the series and march toward a dominant 2-0 lead.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>England, however, will not go down without a fight. Jos Buttler&rsquo;s valiant 68 and Jofra Archer&rsquo;s fiery spell were bright sparks in an otherwise forgettable outing for the visitors in Kolkata. Brendon McCullum&rsquo;s men will need their Bazball spirit to fire on all cylinders if they are to overcome a rampaging Indian side in their own backyard.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The battle lines are drawn. Can India deliver another masterclass and delight their home fans, or will England rise from the ashes and level the series? One thing is certain&mdash;Chennai is about to witness a cricketing spectacle for the ages!<br />\n<br />\nPitch Report by Deep Dasgupta and Nick Knight:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;Chennai hosts its first T20I in nearly seven years on a surface that promises compelling cricket. The venue features moderate boundaries - around 67m square and 75m straight - providing balanced dimensions for both batters and bowlers.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The black soil pitch shows some surface cracks but maintains a protective grass layer. While pacers will find decent purchase hitting the deck, spinners can expect workable bounce without excessive turn. The surface should favor batting initially but might lose some pace as the game progresses.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Given these conditions and minimal dew expectations, a target around 180 appears competitive. The ground&#39;s characteristics suggest an even contest between bat and ball, though batters might hold a slight advantage in the early stages.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Toss Update</strong>: <span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India won the toss and will be chasing!&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Surya Kunar Yadav:</strong><br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot; We are going to bowl first.&nbsp;The surface looks promising, and we&#39;re anticipating even better conditions under lights. Our focus remains on executing the fundamentals well. Can&#39;t wait to get started. Team spirit really shows in our fielding efforts. Regarding team updates: We&#39;ll be missing Nitish, while Rinku is unavailable for a couple of matches. We&#39;re bringing Washington and Dhruv into the lineup.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Jos Buttler:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;We also preferred to bowl first. Our game strategy remains consistent - we&#39;re just aiming for better execution. Looking forward to good batting conditions. Two changes: Smith replaces the unwell Bethell, and Carse comes in for Atkinson.</strong>&quot;</span></p>\n",

Tilak Varma emerged as the hero of the night with a gritty unbeaten 72 off 55 balls, guiding the hosts to a challenging target of 166 on a tricky Chennai wicket.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Opting to bowl first, India&rsquo;s bowlers once again delivered a disciplined performance, restricting England to 165/9 in their 20 overs. Varun Chakravarthy and Axar Patel were the standout performers with two wickets apiece, applying the brakes on England&rsquo;s scoring. Jos Buttler anchored the innings with a crucial 45, while late fireworks from Brydon Carse and Jamie Smith added valuable runs to push England to a competitive total.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Chasing 166, India&rsquo;s top order faltered on a surface offering assistance to the bowlers. However, Tilak Varma held his nerve, constructing a mature knock under pressure. Down the order, Washington Sundar chipped in with a crucial 26, adding vital runs in a tense chase. For England, Brydon Carse was the pick of the bowlers, finishing with impressive figures of 3/29, but his efforts weren&rsquo;t enough to prevent India from crossing the line.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>With this hard-fought victory, India now leads the series 2-0. England will need to regroup quickly to stay alive in the contest as the series heads to its third game.<br />\n<br />\nJos Buttler (England Skipper)<br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">&quot;Really competitive match. Full credit to Tilak&#39;s match-winning performance. Our aggressive approach created opportunities, kept them under pressure. Very satisfied with our batting intent - despite losing wickets, we maintained our attacking style. Jamie Smith&#39;s innings was outstanding. While there&#39;s room for improvement, we&#39;re committed to this approach.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Suryakymar Yadav (Indian Skipper)<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;Target of 160 felt competitive and our bowling executed well. The extra batting depth who can bowl has worked for us. While we play aggressively, today&#39;s situation required smart batting - really impressed with Tilak&#39;s knock. Bishnoi and Arshdeep&#39;s batting contributions show their practice is paying off. Team&#39;s on the same page with our goals and approach, which is key to our success.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tilak Varma (Player of The Match)<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;On this two-paced wicket, I adapted my game following Gautam sir&#39;s advice about situational batting. The left-right combination with Bishnoi worked well, making it tricky for bowlers. Our South Africa experience and net practice prepared us well. I just told Bishnoi to maintain his shape and find gaps.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

Dew is expected to play a crucial role, making the toss vital for both teams. India&#39;s fearless approach under skipper Suryakumar Yadav has been the hallmark of their success, with players like Abhishek Sharma and Tilak Varma stepping up in pressure situations. Meanwhile, Varun Chakaravarthy and Axar Patel have consistently troubled England&rsquo;s batting order with their spin wizardry.For England, Jos Buttler remains the key to their batting fortunes, with support needed from the likes of Jamie Smith and Brydon Carse. Jofra Archer and Mark Wood, despite their pace, need to maintain discipline to contain India&rsquo;s in-form batters.India will aim to seal the series with two games to spare and continue their dominant run in T20Is.

Yes, we would have preferred to chase, but it&rsquo;s a good wicket, and the boys have prepared well. The last game was a fantastic contest, and we know we need to be at our absolute best to win tonight. India will come hard at us as usual, and we&rsquo;re ready for the challenge. We&rsquo;re playing the same team, with one change.

A strong all-round performance ensured the visitors bounced back after consecutive losses.Batting first, England posted 171/9 in their 20 overs. Ben Duckett led the charge with a blistering 51 off 28 balls, while Liam Livingstone smashed 43 off 24, including five sixes. Skipper Jos Buttler contributed a steady 24. Varun Chakravarthy was the standout bowler for India, picking up 5/24, and dismantling England&rsquo;s middle and lower order. In reply, India struggled to maintain momentum on a flat track. Abhishek Sharma&rsquo;s brisk 24 and Suryakumar Yadav&rsquo;s quickfire 14 promised a solid start, but wickets fell at regular intervals. Hardik Pandya top-scored with a fighting 40 off 35, but lacked support as the middle-order faltered. Jamie Overton was England&rsquo;s star with the ball, taking 3/24, while Jofra Archer and Brydon Carse chipped in with two wickets each. India managed 145/9, falling short by 26 runs. Despite the loss, the Men in Blue lead the series 2-1</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Suryakumar Yadav | India Captain<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;We expected some dew later, which is why we chose to bowl first. The game was in our hands when Hardik and Axar were batting, but credit to Adil Rashid&mdash;he bowled brilliantly and didn&rsquo;t let us rotate the strike, showing why he&rsquo;s world-class.Every T20 game teaches us something. We need to learn from our mistakes, especially in batting, and make adjustments. Shami will improve as he plays more, and Varun Chakravarthy&rsquo;s hard work is paying off with fantastic results on the field. We&rsquo;ll regroup and aim to bounce back stronger in the next game.&quot;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jos Buttler | England Captain</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;The guys bowled well today, showcasing their skills not just with pace but also by adapting to the conditions.Adil Rashid is, without a doubt, the most important player in our team. His variations are incredible, and we&rsquo;re lucky to have him. Jofra Archer, even if he goes for 60, always bounces back stronger&mdash;he&rsquo;s just that good.Duckett was brilliant; once he gets going, he&rsquo;s hard to stop. The wicket behaved differently than expected, but I think 170 was a competitive score.I loved the way we kept taking the game on. Credit to Adil and Mark Wood for adding those crucial 20 runs for the last wicket&mdash;it made all the difference in the end. Overall, a great effort from the team to stay alive in the series.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Player of the Match: Varun Chakaravarthy&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Unfortunately we couldn&#39;t win this match, but that&rsquo;s the nature of the game. We have to move on and focus on the next one.Playing for the country means taking responsibility, and I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve been able to do that to an extent. I&rsquo;m always prepared for any situation, whether it&rsquo;s bowling four overs on the trot or adapting to different roles.I&rsquo;ve been working on my flipper, and it&rsquo;s coming out well. As I mentioned earlier, there&rsquo;s always room to improve, and I&rsquo;ll keep striving to get better.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",
